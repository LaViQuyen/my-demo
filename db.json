Research affirms the importance of second language education regarding intellectual potential, scholastic achievement, first language skills, citizenship and the economy.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Learning a second language in this context is not learning a second language as a natural process when one acquires a first language. After childhood, the areas of the brain that are responsible for language acquisition become more fixed, and the process of picking up additional languages becomes more academic and less organic. The specific context concerns a person who has learned his or her first language automatically and is now learning a new language through a teacher, self-teaching or teaching oneself with a book or maybe online.<br></div><div><br></div><div>School children can get unexpected benefits from learning a foreign language. Educational research shows that results in English and Science are better for students who study one. The reasons for this are not altogether clear: perhaps the study skills acquired and used for studying another language also strengthen study skills used in other areas and it could also strengthen the ability to analyse and interpret information. It also seems that knowledge of the grammar of students&#8217; native language is often made clearer to them through explicitly learning another language&#8217;s grammar. A foreign language is a whole new system with distinct rules, etymology, and meaning, which are just a few of the complexities of a language. Learning a new one puts the brain to task by recognising this new language structure. As the brain works out meaning and makes full use of this new arsenal to express ideas, it seems that it sharpens skills on reading, negotiating, and problem-solving.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Multi-tasking is stressful to those who are not skilled at it. People who are multilingual are proficient at slipping from one language system to another and using totally different language mechanics. This is very distracting and demanding work, not only for the tongue and language faculties, but also especially for the brain. People who have developed multilingual ability are highly proficient multi-taskers and commit very few errors when juggling various activities.<br></div></div><div><br></div><div><div>Related to this, with other factors held constant, several pieces of research have also shown that multilingual adults experienced the onset of Alzheimer&#8217;s and dementia at a later age of 75 compared to monolingual adults, who had the first signs at age 71. The studies were conducted with other variables such as gender, overall health, educational level, and economic status, but there were no significant results that contributed to the mentioned diseases as significantly as the number of languages spoken. It seems that the more the brain is used, the better its functions work. Learning a new language structure entails familiarising with vocabulary and rules, and converting this memorised information into communication. This strengthens memory, because the brain has built its ability to associate information with mnemonics in order to retain information better. Hence, multilingual people have brains that are more exercised and quicker to recall.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Since a language is a doorway to a particular culture, learning a new language enables a person to have a broader understanding of the race or culture that speaks it. Opening up to a culture allows people to be more flexible and appreciative of other ways of doing and looking at things. As a result, if people are multilingual, they have the advantage of seeing the world from different vantage points. In today&#8217;s interconnectedness, this is a valuable tool and with universal unemployment problems, a multilingual ability is definitely a competitive edge over others. Businesses are of course interested in people who have an ability that improves their intelligence, flexibility, openness to diverse people, and decision-making skills. And these are just bonuses to the evident ability to communicate in several languages and cross-cultural barriers. Additionally, speaking another language can simply give people a lot of pleasure, as they can communicate with others in their native language.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Finally, self-confidence is a normal consequence of learning a new language. By simply mastering one skill, the other faculties are developed. No matter their background, people tend to gravitate around multilingual people because of their skills; others simply find the openness and quick- mindedness of multi-lingual people naturally attractive. It is an interesting outcome, not at all something that is expected as a result when people embark to learn a new language, but trying to understand a language and the heritage that goes with it will put the learner in a position of self- discovery. It makes learners come to terms with how they view the world and other cultures, and have more appreciation of their own.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The cognitive and neurological benefits of learning a foreign language extend from early childhood to old age, as the brain more efficiently processes information and staves off cognitive decline. These cognitive and neurological benefits are instantly apparent, but there occurs a host of social, cultural and personal benefits, among them the ability to explore a culture through its native tongue or talk to someone with whom it might otherwise not be able to communicate. Learning a second language is best introduced at the earliest age possible, but learning it at a much later age is still very much worthwhile.<br></div></div>",

Lying off the east coast of Australia, it covers an area larger than 300,000 square kilometres and is a unique habitat hosting billions of sea creatures. It also is a major source of income to people near the Reef, with tourism now being the key industry in the local towns.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Not all is well with the Great Barrier Reef; there are growing threats, the most serious being climate change. Organisations are working hard to impress upon the world&#8217;s governments the need for urgent action to address climate change globally. To help boost the Reef&#8217;s resilience to climate change, efforts are also being made to take action on the local effects of coastal development, such as from ports and agriculture.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Climate change threatens the Great Barrier Reef in different ways. Firstly, it can increase severe weather events, such as repeated cyclones and flooding. Cyclones can have devastating effects on the Great Barrier Reef, the immediate effect being the physical damage. Fast maturing coral is easily destroyed by storms, while slow maturing, more solid coral generally is spared. All coral though can be affected by the flooding caused by cyclones. Flooding on land can lead to large flood plumes from rivers being expelled into the sea that supports the Great Barrier Reef. Freshwater flood plumes can have a number of effects, including killing coral at shallow depths. Large scale flooding can carry various land-based pollutants, such as fertilisers, herbicides and the worst, pesticides, out to the Reef, which can have a devastating effect. A lesser-known problem is that earth or residue that is carried out to sea can affect coral growing in the deep water, as it can block out the light that coral needs to survive. In some locations, approximately 10 per cent of corals have bleached in shallow waters, indicating that the run-off is causing stress to reefs. Australian scientists have also observed sunken logs and terrestrial debris breaking up fragile corals in wave-exposed sections of the reefs. Although flood plumes are natural events, scientists predict that climate change worsens their impact. Expected increases in cyclone intensity will increase the size and frequency of flood events and thus the quantity of land-based runoff and pollutants making it to the Reef.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In the long-term, ocean acidification is likely to be the most significant impact of a changing climate on the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem. The oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and are estimated to have absorbed about half the excess carbon dioxide released by human activities in the past 200 years. This absorbed carbon dioxide is resulting in chemical&#160;changes in the ocean, which is referred to as ocean acidification. Although the chemistry is simple and well understood, its effect on marine life is much less well known, as the process has only been recognised for around a decade. Even relatively small increases in ocean acidity decrease the capacity of corals to build skeletons, which in turn decreases their capacity to create living environments for the Reef&#8217;s marine life.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Climate change is also causing increases in sea surface temperatures and atmospheric temperatures. A lack of cloud cover and also freshwater run-off can all contribute to this. Temperature is a key environmental factor controlling the distribution and diversity of marine life; it is critical to reef building and controls the rate of coral reef growth more than anything. All animals and plants have temperature limits and when these are exceeded, natural processes break down. On coral reefs, surface temperature changes affect the relationship of mutual dependence between some animals and the algae that live within their tissues. The temperature gradient along the Great Barrier Reef has shifted markedly over the last century and is likely to continue to rise over the present century. Whatever climate scenario is used, it is predicted that by 2035, the average sea surface temperature will be warmer than any previously recorded.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Rising sea levels are another significant danger, because much of the Great Barrier Reef coastline is low-lying. Predictions of a future increase in sea levels are highly variable, but large changes in sea levels can mean land inundation, which will cause significant changes in tidal habitats, such as saltwater intrusion into low-lying freshwater habitats like mangroves. Sea levels on the Great Barrier Reef have already risen by approximately three millimetres per year since 1991, due to a combination of thermal expansion in the oceans and, most significantly, glaciers melting. Changes in sea levels from temperature increases are time-dependent and uncertain, because they are partly linked to the collapse of the Earth&#8217;s great ice shelves. Reefs will probably be able to accommodate a sea level rise of three millimetres, however, as the rate of sea level rise increases, the Reef&#8217;s coral will be more and more affected.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It seems that local people are motivated to change in order to protect the Great Barrier Reef, however, the worst threats to the Reef are because of climate change issues. As long as this continues, the Great Barrier Reef will continue to be in danger and with many countries in the world refusing to take action that might threaten their economies, it does not really matter how behaviours are changed in Australia.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Glossary</div><div><br></div><div>Flood plume&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A body of water that spreads out in a feather shape</div><div><br></div><div>Inundation&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Flooding</div></div>",

They believed that music was such a powerful force that it could stir men into bravery on the battlefields or it could impose moral order and civilising harmony on unruly pupils. The rhythms and melodies of music can help words to stick in the brain much more effectively than if those words were delivered as speech alone, and music can also convey a particular mood.<br></div><div><br></div><div>By the twentieth century, music&#8217;s emotional force was irresistible to advertisers, who wanted to influence their audiences into buying their products. Mass advertising using soundtracks began in the 1920&#8217;s and 1930&#8217;s with commercial radio in the United States, and, by the 1950&#8217;s, most radio advertisements included an advertising jingle, which would help promote the products.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Music has also been central to television advertising since the 1950&#8217;s, particularly because music can convey an emotional or subliminal message. A recently-published book describes how music was used in a TV commercial to sell Ford cars in 1959. Ford wanted to sell a particular car as an economy model, and they wanted to point out to potential buyers that it would actually save them lots of money on miles per gallon and other money-saving features. However, they worried that this might make the vehicle be perceived as low quality. To avoid this, the advertisers accompanied the advertisement with a soundtrack using lush string music, not usually associated with low price items, and the sales rocketed. The advert was judged a massive success because of the high quality subliminal message given by the music.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Music can serve the overall promotional goals in one or more of several capacities. Good music can contribute to the effectiveness of an advertisement merely by making it more attractive. A good advertisement engages the attention of an audience, and the most straightforward way of achieving this is to make it entertaining. Music serves to engage listeners&#8217; attention and render the advertisement less of an unwanted intrusion.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Music may also be employed in various structural roles. Perhaps the most important structural role is in tying together a sequence of visual images and/or a series of dramatic episodes, narrative voice-overs, or a list of product appeals. Historically originating in film music, advertising&#160;music can also be structurally employed as simply an uninterrupted background, or to heighten or highlight dramatic moments.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A third important function for music is to intensify the familiarity of a product. Consumers are known to favour products that elicit some degree of memory, even if it is merely the product&#8217;s name. It is one of the peculiarities of human audition and cognition that music tends to linger in the listener&#8217;s mind. Surprisingly, such musical lingering may occur even when the mind is an unwilling host. Thus, the association of music with the identity of a certain product may substantially aid product recall.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A fourth technique of musical enhancement is the use of lyrical language. Vocal music permits the conveyance of a verbal communication in a non-spoken way. Language utterances can sound much less naive or self-indulgent when couched within a musical phrase rather than being simply spoken. An individual can respectably sing things that would sound utterly trite if said.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Last is the use of music to enhance an advertisement&#8217;s credibility and authority. Indeed, it may be the case that effective targeting is merely the result of the formation of proper authority. A simple way of creating this is through specialist testimony or employing celebrities. However, over periods of time, consumers become resistant to the means by which advertisers establish authority. One sophisticated way of getting round this is through music. Musical authority can be established most readily through quotation, allusion, or plagiarism.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The role of music in advertising recognises that music is a really powerful tool for selling things and this success has created added responsibilities to those people who wish to become music composers. From the middle of the twentieth century, composers have increasingly had to face extreme constraints if they have written music for films or TV or other media. In the 1930&#8217;s, the rise of films with soundtracks led to a new type of commission for composers, where they had to tailor their music to a film scenario, to its narrative pace, and to the emotions of a character. They had to write music that was of a precise length, down to the nearest second, and more recently, film and TV composers have written so-called library music, where their soundtrack is categorised by describing its emotional evocation, and can be used in a variety of programmes. Viewers may have had the experience of watching a television programme and thinking, &#8220;I actually recognise that music from a previous series or a completely different programme.&#8221; This is because the programme is using this so-called library music, where a composer has written music that is supposed to represent joy or the sun rising, and that music will then be reused whenever the producer of a film or a TV programme enters those particular emotional keywords into the database of library music.<br></div><div><br></div><div>However one measures good music, it must be acknowledged that, on a second-for-second basis, music created for the media, and especially for advertising, is perhaps the most meticulously crafted music in history. Nationally produced television advertisements in particular may be considered among the most highly polished cultural artifacts ever created. Whether this is ethical or not is an altogether different question.<br></div></div>",

Living without the Internet would be a significant inconvenience today, but without electricity, life as we know now it would collapse. Since we started using electricity, which was in the middle of the nineteenth century, we have worked on ways to move and store it easily and efficiently and one of the most common ways of storing electricity has been the battery. A battery does not actually store electricity. A battery, which is actually an electric cell, is a device that produces electricity from a chemical reaction. The story of the battery is one of people trying to create different compounds to create an electric current. The two goals on improving batteries have always been to create ones that can produce an electric current for a long time and to make them smaller and smaller.<div>&#160;</div><div>Alessandro Volta is credited with creating in 1800 the first battery and the first practical method of generating electricity. Luigi Galvani, another Italian scientist and contemporary of Volta, almost made the discovery, but misinterpreted his research results. Using a frog&#8217;s leg in an experiment, Galvani concluded that the electric current was &#8216;animal electricity&#8217; and did not come from the apparatus he had set up. Volta&#8217;s battery was made by piling up layers of silver and paper or cloth, soaked in salt, and zinc. These layers were assembled, without paper or cloth between the zinc and silver, until the current was created.</div><div><br><div>Volta&#8217;s battery was not good for delivering currents for any significant duration. This restriction&#10;was overcome in the Daniell Cell in 1820. Using different chemicals, John Daniell used a copper&#10;pot, copper sulphate, sulphuric acid and mercury to produce his electric current.&#160;<span>Although we now&#10;know better than to put mercury into batteries, this battery, which produced about 1.1 volts, was&#10;used to power telegraphs, telephones, and even to ring doorbells in homes for over 100 years.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>Although many other chemical combinations were used in batteries over the years, the lead acid&#10;battery is one that stands out. First made in 1859, it was further improved in 1881 and this design&#10;even now forms the basis of the modern lead acid battery found in cars.</div><div><br></div><div>One very common battery used today is the lithium-ion battery, which was developed by the&#10;United States&#8217; Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) as a part of their efforts during the Cold War. The&#10;idea surrounding the lithium-ion battery was to create a power source that could provide a longduration, high-density energy supply in a small package. In the early 1960&#8217;s, both the private and&#10;public sectors were experimenting with creating batteries using lithium, but the breakthrough in&#10;the chemistry was achieved by adding the ion into the equation. Not long after its invention, the&#10;CIA shared the lithium-ion battery concept with the public and a company working on an&#10;exploratory project developed and created the first patent for the lithium-ion battery for&#10;commercial use in 1968. Used for a variety of different applications, the first lithium-ion battery&#10;was a game-changer in the medical industry, where it is used as the power source in heart&#10;pacemakers.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div><span>Today</span><span>, the lithium-ion battery is the most common type of battery used in pacemakers, because&#10;of its reliability and life span. Most lithium-ion batteries can last 10 years or longer in a cardiac&#10;pacemaker. What makes lithium-ion batteries even more valuable in cardiac pacemakers is that,&#10;when the battery nears the end of its life, the voltage begins to decrease. Because of the battery&#8217;s&#10;decreasing voltage, electrical designers can design an indicator for the pacemaker that allows the&#10;device to inform the doctor a new battery is needed. The battery can then be changed safely&#10;before it completely discharges. Lithium-ion batteries can also be used for other medical&#10;applications, including neurostimulation and insulin pumps for diabetics.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Whilst people consider the mid-nineteenth century to have been when civilisation started using&#10;electricity, there has been a discovery of what could be a battery that seems to indicate that&#10;electricity was used long ago. What has become known as the Parthian Battery was found on a&#10;railway construction site in 1936. Dating back 2,000 years, the &#8216;battery&#8217; would have comprised a&#10;clay jar filled with a vinegar solution. An iron rod was put into the middle of the jar and encircled&#10;with copper wire. Tests have shown that this &#8216;battery&#8217; could produce 2 volts of electricity. It would&#10;have not been used for electricity as we generally use it today, but it has been theorised it could&#10;have been used for electroplating objects with metals, such as gold or silver. Most scientists reject&#10;these theories nowadays and hypothesise that the &#8216;battery&#8217; was more likely to have been used for&#10;the storage of scrolls.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Although battery research is proceeding at a steady pace, with an average annual gain in capacity&#10;of six per cent, what scientists are hoping for is that a battery will be developed that can last even&#10;longer and be lighter and smaller. One completely different technology that is being explored is&#10;to create a battery that can power a house; size would not be such an issue, but its generating&#10;capacity and length of life would have to be something totally different from what we have yet&#10;experienced.</div></div>",

          "content": "<div><b>Can All Reading Help Children?</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>It is generally acknowledged that reading is an important part of a child&#8217;s learning process.&#10;Reading is a way for children to make connections between what they already know and what&#10;they see around them. These connections help children understand the world they are in, and,&#10;through books, children are exposed to characters and cultures that they may not otherwise&#10;interact with in real life.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>A recent debate has examined what kinds of reading are best for children and whether any type of&#10;reading is beneficial. Many children are attracted to one genre or type of book, or they may have&#10;a favourite author that they like to read time and time again. Even though children may enjoy&#10;reading a single type of literature, they can be gently introduced to other genres. &#8216;Gently&#8217; is&#10;important, because parents or teachers do not want to push too hard and run the risk of turning&#10;the child off reading. So, why is it important for children to read a variety of books and stories?&#10;Primary school teacher, Carol Anderson explains that there are several good reasons. &#8220;The&#10;exposure to different authors and genres of books can give your child insight into other societies,&#10;worldwide locations, and new vocabulary.&#8221; Child-specific genres also provide a key link from the&#10;present to the past. Anderson again explains. &#8220;These genres are often stories that are passed&#10;down from generation to generation and they can be fascinating. Folk tales, fairy tales, fables,&#10;legends and myths, while retaining much of their original flavour and content, have to evolve in&#10;subtle ways to remain meaningful in different eras. They are a great starting point to introduce&#10;children to the concept of a story and to introduce them to different types of stories or genres.&#8221;<b><br></b></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>But is all reading good? There is so much written that is done so badly and with questionable&#10;content. But if those are the only books a reluctant reader will pick up, do their drawbacks&#10;outweigh the benefit of having the student finally turning pages? &#8220;I think you should be glad&#10;they&#8217;re reading anything at all,&#8221; says Patricia Edwards, distinguished professor of language and&#10;literacy at Michigan State University. In her area of specialisation of creating home reading&#10;environments for families, she has become accustomed to the reality that there are often not&#10;typically strong reading role models for students at the end of the day. &#8220;A lot of parents don&#8217;t&#10;have reading as a tradition and there aren&#8217;t any books they would suggest their children read. So&#10;if a student gravitates toward a book, even if it&#8217;s not a classic from the literary canon, that&#10;shouldn&#8217;t be cause for alarm.&#8221;</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>Joining her in the any-reading-is-good camp is Deborah Wooten, a board member of the&#10;Children&#8217;s Literature Assembly. Children learn how language and writing work, even when reading&#160;books dismissed by some as piffle, says Wooten. Wooten is also concerned with other issues.&#10;&#8220;There is decreased readership among children and young adults because of digital distractions.&#8221;&#10;To prove her point, she cites a recent study that showed teenagers spend roughly four hours a&#10;night in front of a television or computer.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>But plenty of parents put themselves in the opposite camp. Don Croft, a parent of a six-year-old&#10;boy, recently wrote in an online review of a book that he saw his child reading, that he had to stop&#10;after every other sentence and talk about how his child should not follow the examples he read&#10;about in this particular book. &#8220;I had to point out that we don&#8217;t call people stupid, we don&#8217;t judge&#10;others by the fact that you can beat them up, and you don&#8217;t deal with being afraid by calling&#10;everyone names and hitting them.&#8221;</span><br></div><div><br></div><div><span>Librarian, Mike Howard, disagrees. &#8220;The books that we believe to be poor quality may introduce&#10;students to reading. After they are hooked with these books, it is our job as educators and parents&#10;to slowly begin introducing new books to these students. As long as the students are able to&#10;develop the skill of visualising what they are reading, they are learning.&#8221; Another point of view is&#10;that &#8216;low quality literature&#8217; can give the opportunity to teach a child to be a critical thinker and&#10;that parents can use the child&#8217;s interest as a springboard for recommendations for other, more&#10;substantive literature. Author, Judy Blume, who has had her books banned by various&#10;organisations, feels that parents worry too much about their children&#8217;s reading material. &#8220;If a book&#10;is really unsuitable, the children themselves will simply self-censor themselves.&#8221; Although Blume&#10;has sold over 80 million of her books worldwide, she still finds people critical of what she has&#10;written. &#8220;A lot of people want to control everything in their children&#8217;s lives, or everything in other&#10;people&#8217;s children&#8217;s lives.&#8221;</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Reading for pleasure is an activity that has real consequences in the life of a child. There is a&#10;growing body of evidence that emphasises the importance of reading for pleasure, for both&#10;educational purposes as well as personal development. The evidence strongly supports the&#10;argument that those who read more are better readers and do significantly better at school.&#10;Children who read very little do not have the benefits that come with reading, and studies show&#10;that when struggling readers are not motivated to read, their opportunities to gain knowledge&#10;decrease significantly. Whether any type of reading can be considered beneficial is moot and it&#10;probably lies with parents and teachers to lay down their own beliefs in guiding children&#8217;s reading&#10;patterns.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Glossary<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Piffle &#8211; nonsense or rubbish<br></span></div>",

Historical data are inadequate to identify the geographic source of the 1918 virus. The name &#8216;Spanish&#8217; influenza merely reflects that Spain, which was neutral in World War 1, did not censor their news agencies from publicising the severity of the pandemic in the country, and this made it seem to other countries that the disease was worse there.</span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph B&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>The pandemic did not occur evenly over 1918 and 1919, but came in three severe waves. The first, or so-called spring wave, began in March 1918 and spread unevenly through the United States, Europe, and possibly Asia over the next six months. Illness rates were high, but death rates in most locales were not appreciably above normal. A second or autumn wave spread globally from September to November 1918, was highly fatal and, in many nations, a third wave occurred in early 1919. Clinical similarities led contemporary observers to conclude initially that they were observing the same disease in the successive waves. The differences between the waves seemed to be primarily in the much higher frequency of complicated, severe, and fatal cases in the last two waves. These three extensive pandemic waves of influenza within one year, occurring in rapid succession, with only the briefest of quieter intervals between them, were unprecedented.</span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph C&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>All of these deaths caused a severe disruption in the US economy. Claims against life insurance policies skyrocketed, with one insurance company reporting a 745 per cent rise in the number of claims made. Small businesses, many of which had been unable to operate during the pandemic, went bankrupt. The world economy as a whole was not significantly affected and the 1920&#8217;s actually heralded a growth boom, until the 1929 Wall Street Crash. The US had a great influence on world economics and, although over 650,00 people died in the US, it could have been a lot worse. Throughout history, influenza viruses have mutated and caused pandemics or global epidemics. In 1890, an especially virulent influenza pandemic struck, killing many Americans. Those who survived that pandemic and lived to experience the 1918 pandemic tended to be less susceptible to the disease and so a lot more Americans lived than would have otherwise been the case.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b>&#160;</div><div>In the years following 1919, people seemed eager to forget the pandemic. Given its devastating&#10;impact, the reasons for this forgetfulness are puzzling. It is possible, however, that the pandemic&#8217;s&#160;close association with World War I may have caused this short memory. While more people died from&#10;the pandemic than from World War I, the war had lasted longer than the pandemic and caused greater&#10;and more immediate changes in American society. Influenza hit areas quickly and often, but it&#10;disappeared within a few weeks of its arrival. Many people did not have time to fully realise just how&#10;great the danger was.<span><span><br></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b>&#160;</div><div><span>The 1918 Spanish Influenza pandemic had some curious features. Firstly, overall, nearly half of the&#10;influenza-related deaths in the 1918 pandemic were in young adults of 20 to 40 years of age, a&#10;phenomenon unique to that pandemic year. The 1918 pandemic is also unique among influenza&#10;pandemics in that the absolute risk of influenza death was higher in those under 65 years of age than&#10;in those over 65. Influenza is usually more dangerous for the very young and the old, as their immune&#10;systems are weaker. Secondly, the pandemic was particularly widespread during the summer and&#10;autumn, whilst usually influenza is more widespread in the colder winter months. Finally, in 1918, three&#10;separate recurrences of influenza followed each other with unusual rapidity, resulting in three&#10;explosive pandemic waves within a year&#8217;s time.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>Paragraph F&#160;</b></div><div>The 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic was particularly fatal with more than twice the fatalities of World War&#10;1. Scientists today have isolated the virus and researched why it was so particularly lethal. The theory is&#10;that it often killed through an over-stimulation of people&#8217;s immune systems, a process known as a&#10;cytokine storm. This is when there is an overproduction of immune cells and associated compounds to&#10;fight an infection. As the infection was influenza, the cells congregated in the lungs, and their large&#10;numbers led to inflammation followed by secondary bacterial pneumonia. This secondary disease was&#10;the cause of the many deaths, particularly in healthy young adults, because of their robust immune&#10;systems that could produce so many cytokines. Ironically, the health of the young adults made them&#10;the most affected.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G&#160;</b></div><div>In its disease course, the 1918 pandemic was different in degree, but not in kind, from previous and&#10;subsequent pandemics. Despite the extraordinary number of global deaths, most influenza cases in&#10;1918 were mild and essentially indistinguishable from influenza cases today. Although laboratory&#10;experiments on influenza genes from the 1918 virus suggest that the 1918 and 1918-like viruses seem&#10;to be as sensitive as other typical virus strains to today&#8217;s anti-influenza drugs and even with today&#8217;s&#10;prevention knowledge, the return of a pandemic virus similar to the virus of 1918 would likely kill over&#10;100 million people worldwide, as the ease of travel in today&#8217;s globalised society would aid the&#10;movement of the virus. However, although some characteristics of the 1918 pandemic appear unique,&#10;scientists have concluded that, since it happened once, similar or more favourable conditions could&#10;lead to another equally devastating pandemic.</div><div><br></div><div>Glossary<br></div><div><br></div><div>A pandemic &#8211; a disease active over the whole world or over a country.<br></div><div>Epidemiology &#8211; the science of the origins, spread and control of a disease.<br></div>",

Until the late 18th century, it only grew in one place in the world: a small group of islands in the Banda Sea, part of the Moluccas &#8211; or Spice Islands &#8211; in northeastern Indonesia. The tree is thickly branched with dense foliage of tough, dark green oval leaves, and produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers and pale yellow pear-shaped fruits. The fruit is encased in a fleshy husk. When the fruit is ripe, this husk splits into two halves along a ridge running the length of the fruit. Inside is a purple-brown shiny seed, 2&#8211;3 cm long by about 2 cm across, surrounded by a lacy red or crimson covering called an aril. These are the sources of the two spices nutmeg and mace, the former being produced from the dried seed and the latter from the rail.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Nutmeg was a highly prized and costly ingredient in European cuisine in the Middle Ages, and was used as a flavouring, medicinal, and preservative agent. Throughout this period, the Arabs were the exclusive importers of the spice to Europe. They sold nutmeg for high prices to merchants based in Venice, but they never revealed the exact location of the source of this extremely valuable commodity. The Arab-Venetian dominance of the trade finally ended in 1512, when the Portuguese reached the Banda Islands and began exploiting its precious resources.&#160;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Always in danger of competition from neighbouring Spain, the Portuguese began subcontracting their spice distribution to Dutch traders. Profits began to flow into the Netherlands, and the Dutch commercial fleet swiftly grew into one of the largest in the world. The Dutch quietly gained control of most of the shipping and trading of spices in Northern Europe. Then, in 1580, Portugal fell under Spanish rule, and by the end of the 16th century the Dutch found themselves locked out of the market. As prices for pepper, nutmeg, and other spices soared across Europe, they decided to fight back.prices for pepper, nutmeg, and other spices soared across Europe, they decided to fight back.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160; In 1602, Dutch merchants founded the VOC, a trading corporation better known as the Dutch East India Company. By 1617, the VOC was the richest commercial operation in the world. The company had 50,000 employees worldwide, with a private army of 30,000 men and a fleet of 200 ships. At the same time, thousands of people across Europe were dying of the plague, a highly contagious and deadly disease. Doctors were desperate for a way to stop the spread of this disease, and they decided nutmeg held the cure. Everybody wanted nutmeg, and many were willing to spare no expense to have it. Nutmeg bought for a few pennies in Indonesia could be sold for 68,000 times its original cost on the streets of London. The only problem was the short supply. And that&#8217;s where the Dutch found their opportunity.&#160;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;The Banda Islands were ruled by local sultans who insisted on maintaining a neutral trading policy towards foreign powers. This allowed them to avoid the presence of Portuguese or Spanish troops on their soil, but it also left them unprotected from other invaders. In 1621, the Dutch arrived and took over. Once securely in control of the Bandas, the Dutch went to work protecting their new investment. They concentrated all nutmeg production into a few easily guarded areas, uprooting and destroying any trees outside the plantation zones. Anyone caught growing a nutmeg seedling or carrying seeds without the proper authority was severely punished. In addition, all exported nutmeg was covered with lime to make sure there was no chance a fertile seed which could be grown elsewhere would leave the islands. There was only one obstacle to Dutch domination. One of the Banda Islands, a sliver of land called Run, only 3 km long by less than 1 km wide, was under the control of the British. After decades of fighting for control of this tiny island, the Dutch and British arrived at a compromise settlement, the Treaty of Breda, in 1667. Intent on securing their hold over every nutmeg-producing island, the Dutch offered a trade: if the British would give them the island of Run, they would in turn give Britain a distant and much less valuable island in North America. The British agreed. That other island was Manhattan, which is how New Amsterdam became New York. The Dutch now had a monopoly over the nutmeg trade which would last for another century.&#160;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Then, in 1770, a Frenchman named Pierre Poivre successfully smuggled nutmeg plants to safety in Mauritius, an island off the coast of Africa. Some of these were later exported to the Caribbean where they thrived, especially on the island of Grenada. Next, in 1778, a volcanic eruption in the Banda region caused a tsunami that wiped out half the nutmeg groves. Finally, in 1809, the British returned to Indonesia and seized the Banda Islands by force. They returned the islands to the Dutch in 1817, but not before transplanting hundreds of nutmeg seedlings to plantations in several locations across southern Asia. The Dutch nutmeg monopoly was over.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Today, nutmeg is grown in Indonesia, the Caribbean, India, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka, and world nutmeg production is estimated to average between 10,000 and 12,000 tonnes per year.</span><br></div>",

The automotive sector is well used to adapting to automation in manufacturing. The implementation of robotic car manufacture from the 1970s onwards led to significant cost savings and improvements in the reliability and flexibility of vehicle mass production. A new challenge to vehicle production is now on the horizon and, again, it comes from automation. However, this time it is not to do with the manufacturing process, but with the vehicles themselves.</font></span><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Research projects on vehicle automation are not new. Vehicles with limited self&#173; driving capabilities have been around for more than 50 years, resulting in significant contributions towards driver assistance systems. But since Google announced in 2010 that it had been trialling self-driving cars on the streets of California, progress in this field has quickly gathered pace.</font><br><p></p><div><span><br></span></div><div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>B</b>.&#160;</font><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">There are many reasons why technology is advancing so fast. One frequently cited motive is safety; indeed, research at the UK's Transport Research Laboratory has demonstrated that more than 90 percent of road collisions involve human error as a contributory factor, and it is the primary cause in the vast majority. Automation may help to reduce the incidence of this.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Another aim is to free the time people spend driving for other purposes. If the vehicle can do some or all of the driving, it may be possible to be productive, to socialise or simply to relax while automation systems have responsibility for safe control of the vehicle. If the vehicle can do the driving, those who are challenged by existing mobility models - such as older or disabled travellers - may be able to enjoy significantly greater travel autonomy.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>C</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Beyond these direct benefits, we can consider the wider implications for transport and society, and how manufacturing processes might need to respond as a result. At present, the average car spends more than 90 percent of its life parked. Automation means that initiatives for car-sharing become much more viable, particularly in urban areas with significant travel demand. If a significant proportion of the population chooses to use shared automated vehicles, mobility demand can be met by far fewer vehicles.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>D</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">The Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigated automated mobility in Singapore, finding that fewer than 30 percent of the vehicles currently used would be required if fully automated car sharing could be implemented. If this is the case, it might mean that we need to manufacture far fewer vehicles to meet demand.</font></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>However, the number of trips being taken would probably increase, partly because empty vehicles would have to be moved from one customer to the next.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Modelling work by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute suggests automated vehicles might reduce vehicle ownership by 43 percent, but that vehicles' average annual mileage would double as a result. As a consequence, each vehicle would be used more intensively, and might need replacing sooner. This faster rate of turnover may mean that vehicle production will not necessarily decrease.</span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>E</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Automation may prompt other changes in vehicle manufacture. If we move to a model where consumers are tending not to own a single vehicle but to purchase access to a range of vehicles through a mobility provider, drivers will have the freedom to select one that best suits their needs for a particular journey, rather than making a compromise across all their requirements.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Since, for most of the time, most of the seats in most cars are unoccupied, this may boost production of a smaller, more efficient range of vehicles that suit the needs of individuals. Specialised vehicles may then be available for exceptional journeys, such as going on a family camping trip or helping a son or daughter move to university.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>F</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">There are a number of hurdles to overcome in delivering automated vehicles to our roads. These include the technical difficulties in ensuring that the vehicle works reliably in the infinite range of traffic, weather and road situations it might encounter; the regulatory challenges in understanding how liability and enforcement might change when drivers are no longer essential for vehicle operation; and the societal changes that may be required for communities to trust and accept automated vehicles as being a valuable part of the mobility landscape.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>G</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">It's clear that there are many challenges that need to be addressed but, through robust and targeted research, these can most probably be conquered within the next 10 years. Mobility will change in such potentially significant ways and in association with so many other technological developments, such as telepresence and virtual reality, that it is hard to make concrete predictions about the future. However, one thing is certain: change is coming, and the need to be flexible in response to this will be vital for those involved in manufacturing the vehicles that will deliver future mobility.</font></span></div></span></div>",

          "content": "<b>READING PASSAGE 3 </b><br>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.<br><div><span><b>WHAT IS EXPLORATION?</b><br><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;We are all explorers. Our desire to discover, and then share that new-found knowledge, is part of what makes us human - indeed, this has played an important part in our success as a species. Long before the first caveman slumped down beside the fire and grunted news that there were plenty of wildebeest over yonder, our ancestors had learnt the value of sending out scouts to investigate the unknown. This questing nature of ours undoubtedly helped our species spread around the globe, just as it nowadays no doubt helps the last nomadic Penan maintain their existence in the depleted forests of Borneo, and a visitor negotiate the subways of New York.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Over the years, we've come to think of explorers as a peculiar breed - different from the rest of us, different from those of us who are merely 'well travelled' , even; and perhaps there is a type of person more suited to seeking out the new, a type of caveman more inclined to risk venturing out. That, however, doesn't take away from the fact that we all have this enquiring instinct, even today; and that in all sorts of professions - whether artist, marine biologist or astronomer - borders of the unknown are being tested each day.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Thomas Hardy set some of his novels in Egdon Heath, a fictional area of uncultivated land, and used the landscape to suggest the desires and fears of his characters. He is delving into matters we all recognise because they are common to humanity. This is surely an act of exploration, and into a world as remote as the author chooses. Explorer and travel writer Peter Fleming talks of the moment when the explorer returns to the existence he has left behind with his loved ones. The traveller 'who has for weeks or months seen himself only as a puny and irrelevant alien crawling laboriously over a country in which he has no roots and no background, suddenly encounters his other self, a relatively solid figure, with a place in the minds of certain people'.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;In this book about the exploration of the earth's surface, I have confined myself to those whose travels were real and who also aimed at more than personal discovery. But that still left me with another problem: the word 'explorer' has become associated with a past era. We think back to a golden age, as if exploration peaked somehow in the 19th century - as if the process of discovery is now on the decline, though the truth is that we have named only one and a half million of this planet's species, and there may be more than 10 million - and that's not including bacteria. We have studied only 5 per cent of the species we know. We have scarcely mapped the ocean floors, and know even less about ourselves; we fully understand the workings of only 10 percent of our brains.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Here is how some of today's 'explorers' define the word. Ran Fiennes, dubbed the 'greatest living explorer', said, 'An explorer is someone who has done something that no human has done before - and also done something scientifically useful.' Chris Bonington, a leading mountaineer, felt exploration was to be found in the act of physically touching the unknown: 'You have to have gone somewhere new.' Then Robin Hanbury-Tenison, a campaigner on behalf of remote so-called 'tribal' peoples, said, 'A traveller simply records information about some far-off world, and reports back; but an explorer changes the world.' Wilfred Thesiger, who crossed Arabia's Empty Quarter in 1946, and belongs to an era of unmechanised travel now lost to the rest of us, told me, 'lf I'd gone across by camel when I could have gone by car, it would have been a stunt.' To him, exploration meant bringing back information from a remote place regardless of any great self-discovery.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Each definition is slightly different - and tends to reflect the field of endeavour of each pioneer. It was the same whoever I asked: the prominent historian would say exploration was a thing of the past, the cutting-edge scientist would say it was of the present. And so on. They each set their own particular criteria; the common factor in their approach being that they all had, unlike many of us who simply enjoy travel or discovering new things, both a very definite objective from the outset and also a desire to record their findings.</span><br></div></span></div><br><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;I'd best declare my own bias. As a writer, I'm interested in the exploration of ideas. I've done a great many expeditions and each one was unique. I've lived for months alone with isolated groups of people all around the world, even two 'uncontacted tribes'. But none of these things is of the slightest interest to anyone unless, through my books, I've found a new slant, explored a new idea. Why? Because the world has moved on. The time has long passed for the great continental voyages - another walk to the poles, another crossing of the Empty Quarter. We know how the land surface of our planet lies; exploration of it is now down to the details - the habits of microbes, say, or the grazing behaviour of buffalo. Aside from the deep sea and deep underground, it's the era of specialists. However, this is to disregard the role the human mind has in conveying remote places; and this is what interests me: how a fresh interpretation, even of a well-travelled route, can give its readers new insights.<br></div>",

Transportation is estimated to account for 30% of energy consumption in most of the world&#8217;s most developed nations, so lowering the need for energy-using vehicles is essential for decreasing the environmental impact of mobility. But as more and more people move to cities, it is important to think about other kinds of sustainable travel too. The ways we travel affect our physical and mental health, our social lives, our access to work and culture, and the air we breathe. Engineers are tasked with changing how we travel round cities through urban design, but the engineering industry still works on the assumptions that led to the creation of the energy-consuming transport systems we have now: the emphasis placed solely on efficiency, speed, and quantitative data. We need radical changes, to make it healthier, more enjoyable, and less environmentally damaging to travel around cities.</div><div><br></div><div><b>B.&#160;</b>Dance might hold some of the answers. That is not to suggest everyone should dance their way to work, however healthy and happy it might make us, but rather that the techniques used by choreographers to experiment with and design movement in dance could provide engineers with tools to stimulate new ideas in city-making. Richard Sennett, an influential urbanist and sociologist who has transformed ideas about the way cities are made, argues that urban design has suffered from a separation between mind and body since the introduction of the architectural blueprint.</div><div><br></div><div><b>C.&#160;</b>Whereas medieval builders improvised and adapted construction through their intimate knowledge of materials and personal experience of the conditions on a site, building designs are now conceived and stored in media technologies that detach the designer from the physical and social realities they are creating. While the design practices created by these new technologies are essential for managing the technical complexity of the modern city, they have the drawback of simplifying reality in the process.</div><div><br></div><div><b>D.&#160;</b>To illustrate, Sennett discusses the Peachtree Center in Atlanta, USA, a development typical of the modernist approach to urban planning prevalent in the 1970s. Peachtree created a grid of streets and towers intended as a new pedestrian-friendly downtown for Atlanta. According to Sennett, this failed because its designers had invested too much faith in computer-aided design to tell them how it would operate. They failed to take into account that purpose-built street caf&#233;s could not operate in the hot sun without the protective awnings common in older buildings, and would need energy-consuming air conditioning instead, or that its giant car park would feel so unwelcoming that it would put people off getting out of their cars. What seems entirely predictable and controllable on screen has unexpected results when translated into reality.<div><br></div><div><b>E.&#160;</b>The same is true in transport engineering, which uses models to predict and shape the way people move through the city. Again, these models are necessary, but they are built on specific world views in which certain forms of efficiency and safety are considered and other experiences of the city ignored. Designs that seem logical in models appear counter-intuitive in the actual experience of their users. The guard rails that will be familiar to anyone who has attempted to cross a British road, for example, were an engineering solution to pedestrian safety based on models that prioritise the smooth flow of traffic. On wide major roads, they often guide pedestrians to specific crossing points and slow down their progress across the road by using staggered access points to divide the crossing into two &#8211; one for each carriageway. In doing so they make crossings feel longer, introducing psychological barriers greatly impacting those that are the least mobile, and encouraging others to make dangerous crossings to get around the guard rails. These barriers don't just make it harder to cross the road: they divide communities and decrease opportunities for healthy transport. As a result, many are now being removed, causing disruption, cost, and waste.</div><div><br></div><div><b>F.</b> If their designers had had the tools to think with their bodies &#8211; like dancers &#8211; and imagine how these barriers would feel, there might have been a better solution. In order to bring about fundamental changes to the ways we use our cities, engineering will need to develop a richer understanding of why people move in certain ways, and how this movement affects them. Choreography may not seem an obvious choice for tackling this problem. Yet it shares with engineering the aim of designing patterns of movement within limitations of space. It is an art form developed almost entirely by trying out ideas with the body, and gaining instant feedback on how the results feel. Choreographers have deep understanding of the psychological, aesthetic, and physical implications of different ways of moving.</div><div><br></div><div><b>G.&#160;</b>Observing the choreographer Wayne McGregor, cognitive scientist David Kirsh described how he &#8216;thinks with the body&#8217;. Kirsh argues that by using the body to simulate outcomes, McGregor is able to imagine solutions that would not be possible using purely abstract thought. This kind of physical knowledge is valued in many areas of expertise, but currently has no place in formal engineering design processes. A suggested method for transport engineers is to improvise design solutions and get instant feedback about how they would work from their own experience of them, or model designs at full scale in the way choreographers experiment with groups of dancers. Above all, perhaps, they might learn to design for emotional as well as functional effects.</div></div>",

Flying in vast numbers across North America, with potentially many millions within a single flock, their migration was once one of nature&#8217;s great spectacles. Sadly, the passenger pigeon&#8217;s existence came to an end on 1 September 1914, when the last living specimen died at Cincinnati Zoo. Geneticist Ben Novak is lead researcher on an ambitious project which now aims to bring the bird back to life through a process known as &#8216;de-extinction&#8217;. The basic premise involves using cloning technology to turn the DNA of extinct animals into a fertilised embryo, which is carried by the nearest relative still in existence &#8211; in this case, the abundant band-tailed pigeon &#8211; before being born as a living, breathing animal. Passenger pigeons are one of the pioneering species in this field, but they are far from the only ones on which this cutting-edge technology is being trialled.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>B.</b>&#160;<span>In Australia, the thylacine, more commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger, is another extinct creature which genetic scientists are striving to bring back to life. &#8216;There is no carnivore now in Tasmania that fills the niche which thylacines once occupied,&#8217; explains Michael Archer of the University of New South Wales. He points out that in the decades since the thylacine went extinct, there has been a spread in a &#8216;dangerously debilitating&#8217; facial tumour syndrome which threatens the existence of the Tasmanian devils, the island&#8217;s other notorious resident. Thylacines would have prevented this spread because they would have killed significant numbers of Tasmanian devils. &#8216;If that contagious cancer had popped up previously, it would have burned out in whatever region it started. The return of thylacines to Tasmania could help to ensure that devils are never again subjected to risks of this kind.&#8217;</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>C.</b>&#160;<span>If extinct species can be brought back to life, can humanity begin to correct the damage it has caused to the natural world over the past few millennia? &#8216;The idea of de-extinction is that we can reverse this process, bringing species that no longer exist back to life,&#8217; says Beth Shapiro of University of California Santa Cruz&#8217;s Genomics Institute. &#8216;I don&#8217;t think that we can do this. There is no way to bring back something that is 100 per cent identical to a species that went extinct a long time ago.&#8217; A more practical approach for long-extinct species is to take the DNA of existing species as a template, ready for the insertion of strands of extinct animal DNA to create something new; a hybrid, based on the living species, but which looks and/or acts like the animal which died out.</span></div><div><br></div><div><div><b>D.</b>&#160;<span>This complicated process and questionable outcome begs the question: what is the actual point of this technology? &#8216;For us, the goal has always been replacing the extinct species with a suitable replacement,&#8217; explains Novak. &#8216;When it comes to breeding, band-tailed pigeons scatter and make maybe one or two nests per hectare, whereas passenger pigeons were very social and would make 10,000 or more nests in one hectare.&#8217; Since the disappearance of this key species, ecosystems in the eastern US have suffered, as the lack of disturbance caused by thousands of passenger pigeons wrecking trees and branches means there has been minimal need for regrowth. This has left forests stagnant and therefore unwelcoming to the plants and animals which evolved to help regenerate the forest after a disturbance. According to Novak, a hybridized band-tailed pigeon, with the added nesting habits of a passenger pigeon, could, in theory, re-establish that forest disturbance, thereby creating a habitat necessary for a great many other native species to thrive.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>E.</b>&#160;<span>Another popular candidate for this technology is the woolly mammoth. George Church, professor at Harvard Medical School and leader of the Woolly Mammoth Revival Project, has been focusing on cold resistance, the main way in which the extinct woolly mammoth and its nearest living relative, the Asian elephant, differ. By pinpointing which genetic traits made it possible for mammoths to survive the icy climate of the tundra, the project&#8217;s goal is to return mammoths, or a mammoth-like species, to the area. &#8216;My highest priority would be preserving the endangered Asian elephant,&#8217; says Church, &#8216;expanding their range to the huge ecosystem of the tundra. Necessary adaptations would include smaller ears, thicker hair, and extra insulating fat, all for the purpose of reducing heat loss in the tundra, and all traits found in the now extinct woolly mammoth.&#8217; This repopulation of the tundra and boreal forests of Eurasia and North America with large mammals could also be a useful factor in reducing carbon emissions &#8211; elephants punch holes through snow and knock down trees, which encourages grass growth. This grass growth would reduce temperature, and mitigate emissions from melting permafrost.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>F.&#160;</b><span>While the prospect of bringing extinct animals back to life might capture imaginations, it is, of course, far easier to try to save an existing species which is merely threatened with extinction. &#8216;Many of the technologies that people have in mind when they think about de-extinction can be used as a form of &#8220;genetic rescue&#8221;,&#8217; explains Shapiro. She prefers to focus the debate on how this emerging technology could be used to fully understand why various species went extinct in the first place, and therefore how we could use it to make genetic modifications which could prevent mass extinctions in the future. &#8216;I would also say there&#8217;s an incredible moral hazard to not do anything at all,&#8217; she continues. &#8216;We know that what we are doing today is not enough, and we have to be willing to take some calculated and measured risks.'</span></div></div>",

Laughter is universal across all human cultures and even exists in some form in rats, chimps, and bonobos. Like other human emotions and expressions, laughter and humour psychological scientists with rich resources for studying human psychology, ranging from the development of language to the neuroscience of social perception.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Theories focusing on the evolution of laughter point to it as an important adaptation for social communication. Take, for example, the recorded laughter in TV comedy shows. Back in 1950, US sound engineer Charley Douglass hated dealing with the unpredictable laughter of live audiences, so started recording his own &#8216;laugh tracks&#8217;. These were intended to help people at home feel like they were in a social situation, such as a crowded theatre. Douglass even recorded various types of laughter, as well as mixtures of laugher from men, women, and children. In doing so, he picked up on a quality of laughter that is now interesting researchers: a simple &#8216;haha&#8217; communicates a remarkable amount of socially relevant information.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In one study conducted in 2016, samples of laughter from pairs of English-speaking&#160;</span><span>students were recorded at the University of California, Santa Cruz. A team made up of more than 30 psychological scientists, anthropologists, and biologists then played these recording to listeners from 24 diverse societies, from indigenous tribes in New Guinea to city-dwellers in India and Europe. Participants were asked whether they thought the people laughing were friends or strangers. On average, the results were remarkably consistent: worldwide, people&#8217;s guesses were correct approximately 60% of the time.</span></p><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Researchers have also found that different types of laughter serve as codes to complex human social hierarchies. A team led by Christopher Oveis from the University of California, San Diego, found that high-status individuals had different laughs from low-status individuals, and that strangers&#8217; judgements of an individual&#8217;s social status were influenced by the dominant or submissive quality of their laughter. In their study, 48 male college students were randomly assigned to groups of four, with each group composed of two low-status members, who had just joined their college fraternity group, and two high-status members, older student took a turn at being teased by the others, involving the use of mildly insulting nicknames. Analysis revealed that, as expected, high-status individuals produced more dominant laughs and fewer submissive laughs relative to the low-status individuals. Meanwhile, low-status individuals were more likely to change their laughter based on their position of power; that is, the newcomers produced more dominant laughs when they were in the &#8216;powerful&#8217; role of teasers. Dominant laughter was higher in pitch, louder, and more variable in tone than submissive laughter.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A random group of volunteers then listened to an equal number of dominant and submissive laughs from both the high- and low-status individuals, and were asked to </span><span>estimate the social status of the laughter. In line with predictions, laughers producing dominant laughs were perceived to be significantly higher in status than laughers producing submissive laughs. &#8216;This was particularly true for low-status individuals, who were rated as significantly higher in status when displaying a dominant versus submissive laugh,&#8217; Oveis and colleagues note. &#8216;Thus, by strategically displaying more dominant laughter when the context allows, low-status individuals may achieve higher status in the eyes of others.&#8217; However, high-status individuals were rated as high-status whether&#160;</span><span>they produced their natural dominant laugh or tried to do a submissive one.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Another study, conducted by David Cheng and Lu Wang of Australian National University, was based on the hypothesis that humour might provide a respite from tedious situations in the workplace. This &#8216;mental break&#8217; might facilitate the replenishment of mental resources. To test this theory, the researchers recruited 74 business students, ostensibly for an experiment on perception. First, the students performed a tedious task in which they had to cross out every instance of the letter &#8216;e&#8217; over two pages of text. The students then were randomly assigned to watch a video clip eliciting either humour, contentment, or neutral feelings. Some watched a clip of the BBC comedy Mr. Bean, others a relaxing scene with dolphins swimming in the ocean, and others a factual video about the management profession.</span></p><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The students then completed a task requiring persistence in which they were asked to guess the potential performance of employees based on provided profiles, and were told that making 10 correct assessments in a row would lead to a win. However, the software was programmed such that is was nearly impossible to achieve 10 consecutive correct answers. Participants were allowed to quit the task at any point. </span><span>Students who had watched the Mr. Bean video ended up spending significantly more time working on the task, making twice as many predictions as the other two groups.</span></p><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Cheng and Wang then replicated these results in a second study, during which they had participants complete long multiplication questions by hand. Again, participants who watched the humorous video spent significantly more time working on this tedious task and completed more questions correctly than did the students in either of the other groups.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&#8216;Although humour has been found to help relieve stress and facilitate social relationships, traditional view of task performance implies that individuals should avoid things such as humour that may distract them from the accomplishment of task goals,&#8217; Cheng and Wang conclude. &#8216;We suggest that humour is not only enjoyable but more importantly, energising.&#8217;</span></p></span></span></span>",

Could it help cities face the threats to our food supplies?<br><br></i></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>On top of a striking new exhibition hall in southern Paris, the world&#8217;s largest urban rooftop farm has started to bear fruit. Strawberries that are small, intensely flavoured and resplendently red sprout abundantly from large plastic tubes. Peer inside and you see the tubes are completely hollow, the roots of dozens of strawberry plants dangling down inside them. From identical vertical tubes nearby burst row upon row of lettuces; near those are aromatic herbs, such as basil, sage and peppermint. Opposite, in narrow, horizontal trays packed not with soil but with coconut fibre, grow cherry tomatoes, shiny aubergines and brightly coloured chards.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Pascal Hardy, an engineer and sustainable development consultant, began experimenting with vertical farming and aeroponic growing towers- as the soil-free plastic tubes are known &#8211; on his Paris apartment block roof five years ago. The&#160;</span><span>urban rooftop space above the exhibition hall is somewhat bigger: 14,000 square metres and almost exactly the size of a couple of football pitches. Already, the team of young urban farmers who tend it have picked, in one day, 3,000 lettuces and 150 punnets of strawberries. When the remaining two thirds of the vast open area are in production, 20 staff will harvest up to 1,000 kg of perhaps 35 different varieties of fruit and vegetables, every day. &#8216;We&#8217;re not ever, obviously, going to feed the whole city this way,&#8217; cautions Hardy. &#8216;In the urban environment you&#8217;re working with very significant practical constraints, clearly, on what you can do and where. But if enough unused space can be developed like this, there&#8217;s no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t eventually target maybe between 5% and 10% of consumption.&#8217;</span></p></span><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Perhaps most significantly, however, this is a real-life showcase for the work of Hardy&#8217;s flourishing urban agriculture consultancy, Agripolis, which is currently fielding enquiries from around the world to design, build and equip a new breed of soil-free inner-city farm. &#8216;The method&#8217;s advantages are many,&#8217; he says. &#8216;First, I don&#8217;t much like the fact that most of the fruit and vegetables we eat have been treated with something like 17 different pesticides, or that the intensive farming techniques that produced them are such huge generators of greenhouse gases. I don&#8217;t much like the fact, either, that they&#8217;ve travelled an average of 2,000 refrigerated kilometres to my plate, that their quality is so poor, because the varieties are selected for their capacity to withstand such substantial journeys, or that 80% of the price I pay goes to wholesalers and transport companies, not the producers.&#8217;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Produce grown using this soil-free method, on the other hand- which relies solely on a small quantity of water, enriched with organic nutrients, pumped around a closed circuit of pipes, towers and trays- is &#8216;produced up here, and sold locally, just down there. It barely travels at all,&#8217; Hardy says. &#8216;You can select crop varieties for&#160;</span><span>their flavour, not their resistance to the transport and storage chain, and you can pick them when they&#8217;re really at their best, and not before.&#8217; No soil is exhausted, and the water that gently showers the plants&#8217; roots every 12 minutes is recycled, so the method uses 90% less water than a classic intensive farm for the same yield.</span></p></span><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Urban farming is not, of course, a new phenomenon. Inner-city agriculture is booming from Shanghai to Detroit and Tokyo to Bangkok. Strawberries are being grown in disused shipping containers, mushrooms in underground carparks. Aeroponic farming, he says, is &#8216;virtuous&#8217;. The equipment weighs little, can be installed on almost any flat surface and is cheap to buy: roughly 100 to 150 per square metre. It is cheap to run, too, consuming a tiny fraction of the electricity used by some techniques.</span></p><br><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Produce grown this way typically sells at prices that, while generally higher than those of classic intensive agriculture, are lower than soil-based organic growers. There are limits to what farmers can grow this way, of course, and much of the produce is suited to the summer months. &#8216;Root vegetables we cannot do, at least not yet,&#8217; he says. &#8216;Radishes are OK, but carrots, potatoes, that kind of thing- the roots are simply too long. Fruit trees are obviously not an option. And beans tend to take up a lot of space for not much return.&#8217; Nevertheless, urban farming of the kind being practised in Paris is one part of a bigger and fast-changing picture that is bringing food production closer to our lives.</span></p></span></font>",

The same tree can be valued very differently by each person who looks at it. A large, straight black cherry tree has high value as timber to be cut into logs or made into furniture, but for a landowner more interested in wildlife habitat, the real value of that stem (or trunk) may be the food it provides to animals. Likewise, if the tree suffers from black knot disease, its value for timber decreases, but to a woodworker interested in making bowls, it brings an opportunity for a unique and beautiful piece of art.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>B.</b> In the past, Pennsylvania landowners were solely interested in the value of their trees as high-quality timber. The norm was to remove the stems of highest quality and leave behind poorly formed trees that were not as well suited to the site where they grew. This practice, called &#8216;high-grading&#8217;, has left a legacy of &#8216;low-use wood&#8217; in the forests. Some people even call these &#8216;junk trees&#8217;, and they are abundant in Pennsylvania. These trees have lower economic value for traditional timber markets, compete for growth with higher-value trees, shade out desirable regeneration and decrease the health of a stand leaving it more vulnerable to poor weather and disease. Management that specifically targets low-use wood can help landowners manage these forest health issues, and wood energy markets help promote this.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>C.</b> Wood energy markets can accept less expensive wood material of lower quality than would be suitable for traditional timber markets. Most wood used for energy in Pennsylvania is used to produce heat or electricity through combustion. Many schools and hospitals use wood boiler systems to heat and power their facilities, many homes are primarily heated with wood, and some coal plants incorporate wood into their coal streams to produce electricity. Wood can also be gasified for electrical generation and can even be made into liquid fuels like ethanol and gasoline for lorries and cars. All these products are made primarily from low-use wood. Several tree- and plant-cutting approaches, which could greatly improve the long-term quality of a forest, focus strongly or solely on the use of wood for those markets.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>D.</b> One such approach is called a Timber Stand Improvement (TSI) Cut. In a TSI Cut, really poor-quality tree and plant material is cut down to allow more space, light, and other resources to the highest-valued stems that remain. Removing invasive plants might be another primary goal of a TSI Cut. The stems that are left behind might then grow in size and develop more foliage and larger crowns or tops that produce more coverage for wildlife; they have a better chance to regenerate in a less crowded environment. TSI Cuts can be tailored to one farmer&#8217;s specific management goals for his or her land.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>E.</b> Another approach that might yield a high amount of low-use wood is a Salvage Cut. With the many pests and pathogens visiting forests including hemlock wooly adelgid, Asian longhomed beetle, emerald ash borer, and gypsy moth, to name just a few, it is important to remember that those working in the forests can help ease these issues through cutting procedures. These types of cut reduce the number of sick trees and seek to manage the future spread of a pest problem. They leave vigorous trees that have stayed healthy enough to survive the outbreak.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>F.</b> A Shelterwood Cut, which only takes place in a mature forest that has already been thinned several times, involves removing all the mature trees when other seedlings have become established. This then allows the forester to decide which tree species are regenerated. It leaves a young forest where all trees are at a similar point in their growth. It can also be used to develop a two-tier forest so that there are two harvests and the money that comes in is spread out over a decade or more.</p><p dir=\"ltr\"><b>G.</b> Thinnings and dense and dead wood removal for fire prevention also center on the production of low-use wood. However, it is important to remember that some retention of what many would classify as low-use wood is very important. The tops of trees that have been cut down should be left on the site so that their nutrients cycle back into the soil. In addition, trees with many cavities are extremely important habitats for insect predators like woodpeckers, bats and small mammals. They help control problem insects and increase the health and resilience of the forest. It is also important to remember that not all small trees are low-use. For example, many species like hawthorn provide food for wildlife. Finally, rare species of trees in a forest should also stay behind as they add to its structural diversity.</p>",

Researchers are working to reduce these threats<br><br></i></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>A. </b>Last year, commercial companies, military and civil departments and amateurs sent more than 400 satellites into orbit, over four times the yearly average in the previous decade. Numbers could rise even more sharply if leading space companies follow through on plans to deploy hundreds to thousands of large constellations of satellites to space in the next few years.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>All that traffic can lead to disaster. Ten years ago, a US commercial Iridium satellite smashed into an inactive Russian communications satellite called Cosmos-2251, creating thousands of new pieces of space shrapnel that now threaten other satellites in low Earth orbit &#8211; the zone stretching up to 2,000 kilometres in altitude. Altogether, there are roughly 20,000 human-made objects in orbit, from working satellites to small rocket pieces. And satellite operators can&#8217;t steer away from every potential crash, because each move consumes time and fuel that could otherwise be used for the spacecraft&#8217;s main job.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>B.</b> </span><span>Concern about space junk goes back to the beginning of the satellite era, but the number of objects in orbit is rising so rapidly that researchers are investigating new ways of attacking the problem. Several teams are trying to improve methods for assessing what is in orbit, so that satellite operators can work more efficiently in ever-more-crowded space. Some researchers are now </span><span>starting to compile a massive data set that includes the best possible information on where everything is in orbit. Others are developing taxonomies of space &#8211; working on measuring properties such as the shape and size of an object, so that satellite operators know how much to worry about what&#8217;s coming their way.</span></p><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The alternative, many say, is unthinkable. Just a few uncontrolled space crashes could generate enough debris to set off a runaway cascade of fragments, rendering near-Earth space unusable. &#8216;If we go on like this, we will reach a point of no return,&#8217; says Carolin Frueh, an astrodynamical researcher at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana.</span></p></span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span> <b>C. </b></span><span>Even as our ability to monitor space objects increases, so too does the total number of items in orbit. That means companies, governments and other players in space are collaborating in new ways to avoid a shared threat. International groups such as the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee have developed guidelines on space sustainability. Those include inactivating satellites at the end of their useful life by venting pressurised materials or leftover fuel that might lead to explosions. The intergovernmental groups also advise lowering satellites deep enough into the atmosphere that they will burn up or disintegrate within 25 years. But so far, only about half of all missions have abided by this 25-year goal, says Holger Krag, head of the European Space Agency&#8217;s space-debris office in Darmstadt, Germany. Operators of the planned large constellations of satellites say they will be responsible stewards in their enterprises in space, but Krag worries that problems could increase, despite their best intentions. &#8216;What happens to those that fail or go bankrupt?&#8217; he asks. They are probably not going to spend money to remove their satellites from space.&#8217;&#10;&#10;<br><b><br>D. </b></span><span>In theory, given the vastness of space, satellite operators should have plenty of room for all these missions to fly safely without ever nearing another object. So some scientists are tackling the problem of space junk by trying to find out where all the debris is to a high degree of precision. That would alleviate the need for many of the unnecessary manoeuvres that are carried out to avoid potential collisions. &#8216;If you knew precisely where everything was, you would almost never have a problem,&#8217; says Marlon Sorge, a space-debris specialist at the Aerospace Corporation in El Segundo, California.<br><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>E.</b> The field is called space traffic management, because it&#8217;s similar to managing traffic on the roads or in the air. Think about a busy day at an airport, says Moriba Jah, an astrodynamicist at the University of Texas at Austin: planes line up in the sky, landing and taking off close to one another in a carefully choreographed routine. Air-traffic controllers know the location of the planes down to one metre in accuracy. The same can&#8217;t be said for space debris. Not all objects in orbit are known, and even those included in databases are not tracked consistently.&#10;&#10;<br><b><br>F. </b></span><span>An additional problem is that there is no authoritative catalogue that accurately lists the orbits of all known space debris. Jah illustrates this with a web-based database that he has developed. It draws on several sources, such as catalogues maintained by the US and Russian governments, to visualise where objects are in space. When he types in an identifier for a particular space object, the database draws a purple line to designate its orbit. Only this doesn&#8217;t quite work for a number of objects, such as a Russian rocket body designated in the database as object number 32280. When Jah enters that number, the database draws two purple lines: the US and Russian sources contain two completely different orbits for the same object. Jah says that it is almost </span><span>impossible to tell which is correct, unless a third source of information made it possible to cross-correlate.</span></p></span><span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Jah describes himself as a space environmentalist: &#8216;I want to make space a place that is safe to operate, that is free and useful for generations to come.&#8217; Until that happens, he argues, the space community will continue devolving into a tragedy in whic hall spaceflight operators are polluting a common resource.</span></p></span></font>",

Located on Salisbury Plain in southern England, it is comprised of roughly 100 massive upright stones placed in a circular layout.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Archaeologists believe England&#8217;s most iconic prehistoric ruin was built in several stages with the earliest constructed 5,000 or more years ago. First, Neolithic* Britons used primitive tools, which may have been fashioned out of deer antlers, to dig a massive circular ditch and bank, or henge. Deep pits dating back to that era and located within the circle may have once held a ring of timber posts, according to some scholars.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Several hundred years later, it is thought, Stonehenge&#8217;s builders hoisted an estimated 80 bluestones, 43 of which remain today, into standing positions and&#160;placed them in either a horseshoe or circular formation. These stones have been traced all the way to the Preseli Hills in Wales, some 300 kilometres from Stonehenge. How, then, did prehistoric builders without sophisticated tools or engineering haul these boulders, which weigh up to four tons, over such a great distance?<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">According to one long-standing theory among archaeologists, Stonehenge&#8217;s builders fashioned sledges and rollers out of tree trunks to lug the bluestones from the Preseli Hills. They then transferred the boulders onto rafts and floated them first along the Welsh coast and then up the River Avon toward Salisbury Plain; alternatively, they may have towed each stone with a fleet of vessels. More recent archaeological hypotheses have them transporting the bluestones with supersized wicker baskets on a combination of ball bearings and long grooved planks, hauled by oxen.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">As early as the 1970s, geologists have been adding their voices to the debate over how Stonehenge came into being. Challenging the classic image of industrious builders pushing, carting, rolling or hauling giant stones from faraway Wales, some scientists have suggested that it was glaciers, not humans, that carried the bluestones to Salisbury Plain. Most archaeologists have remained sceptical about this theory, however, wondering how the forces of nature could possibly have delivered the exact number of stones needed to complete the circle.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">The third phase of construction took place around 2000 BCE. At this point, sandstone slabs &#8211; known as &#8216;sarsens&#8217; &#8211; were arranged into an outer crescent or ring; some were assembled into the iconic three-pieced structures called trilithons that stand tall in the centre of Stonehenge. Some 50 of these stones are now visible on the site, which may once have contained many more. Radiocarbon dating has&#160;revealed that work continued at Stonehenge until roughly 1600 BCE, with the bluestones in particular being repositioned multiple times.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">But who were the builders of Stonehenge? In the 17th century, archaeologist John Aubrey made the claim that Stonehenge was the work of druids, who had important religious, judicial and political roles in Celtic** society. This theory was widely popularized by the antiquarian William Stukeley, who had unearthed primitive graves at the site. Even today, people who identify as modern druids continue to gather at Stonehenge for the summer solstice. However, in the mid-20th century, radiocarbon dating demonstrated that Stonehenge stood more than 1,000 years before the Celts inhabited the region.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Many modern historians and archaeologists now agree that several distinct tribes of people contributed to Stonehenge, each undertaking a different phase of its construction. Bones, tools and other artefacts found on the site seem to support this hypothesis. The first stage was achieved by Neolithic agrarians who were likely to have been indigenous to the British Isles. Later, it is believed, groups with advanced tools and a more communal way of life left their mark on the site. Some believe that they were immigrants from the European continent, while others maintain that they were probably native Britons, descended from the original builders.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">If the facts surrounding the architects and construction of Stonehenge remain shadowy at best, the purpose of the striking monument is even more of a mystery. While there is consensus among the majority of modern scholars that Stonehenge once served the function of burial ground, they have yet to determine what other purposes it had.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">In the 1960s, the astronomer Gerald Hawkins suggested that the cluster of&#160;megalithic stones operated as a form of calendar, with different points corresponding to astrological phenomena such as solstices, equinoxes and eclipses occurring at different times of the year. While his theory has received a considerable amount of attention over the decades, critics maintain that Stonehenge&#8217;s builders probably lacked the knowledge necessary to predict such events or that England&#8217;s dense cloud cover would have obscured their view of the skies.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">More recently, signs of illness and injury in the human remains unearthed at Stonehenge led a group of British archaeologists to speculate that it was considered a place of healing, perhaps because bluestones were thought to have curative powers.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">--</font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">* Neolithic &#8211; The era, also known as the New Stone Age, which began around 12,000 years ago and ended around 3500 BCE<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">** Celtic &#8211; The Celts were people who lived in Britain and northwest Europe during the Iron Age from 600 BCE to 43 CE</font></div>",

          "content": "<div><b><font size=\"3\">Living with artificial intelligence</font></b></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Powerful artificial intelligence (AI) needs to be reliably aligned with human values, but does this mean AI will eventually have to police those values?<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">This has been the decade of AI, with one astonishing feat after another. A chess-playing AI that can defeat not only all human chess players, but also all previous human-programmed chess machines, after learning the game in just four hours? That&#8217;s yesterday&#8217;s news, what&#8217;s next? True, these prodigious accomplishments are all in so-called narrow AI, where machines perform highly specialised tasks. But many experts believe this restriction is very temporary. By mid-century, we may have artificial general intelligence (AGI) &#8211; machines that can achieve human-level performance on the full range of tasks that we ourselves can tackle.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">If so, there&#8217;s little reason to think it will stop there. Machines will be free of many of the physical constraints on human intelligence. Our brains run at slow biochemical processing speeds on the power of a light bulb, and their size is restricted by the dimensions of the human birth canal. It is remarkable what they accomplish, given these handicaps. But they may be as far from the physical limits of thought as our eyes are from the incredibly powerful Webb Space Telescope.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Once machines are better than us at designing even smarter machines, progress towards these limits could accelerate. What would this mean for us? Could we&#160;ensure a safe and worthwhile coexistence with such machines? On the plus side, AI is already useful and profitable for many things, and super AI might be expected to be super useful and super profitable. But the more powerful AI becomes, the more important it will be to specify its goals with great care. Folklore is full of tales of people who ask for the wrong thing, with disastrous consequences- King Midas, for example, might have wished that everything he touched turned to gold, but didn&#8217;t really intend this to apply to his breakfast.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">So we need to create powerful AI machines that are &#8216;human-friendly&#8217;- that have goals reliably aligned with our own values. One thing that makes this task difficult is that we are far from reliably human-friendly ourselves. We do many terrible things to each other and to many other creatures with whom we share the planet. If superintendent machines don&#8217;t do a lot better than us, we&#8217;ll be in deep trouble. We&#8217;ll have powerful new intelligence amplifying the dark sides of our own fallible natures.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">For safety&#8217;s sake, then, we want the machines to be ethically as well as cognitively superhuman. We want them to aim for the moral high ground, not for the troughs in which many of us spend some of our time. Luckily they&#8217;ll be smart enough for the job. If there are routes to the moral high ground, they&#8217;ll be better than us at finding them, and steering us in the right direction.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">However, there are two big problems with this utopian vision. One is how we get the machines started on the journey, the other is what it would mean to reach this destination. The &#8216;getting started&#8217; problem is that we need to tell the machines what they&#8217;re looking for with sufficient clarity that we can be confident they will find it &#8211; whatever &#8216;it&#8217; actually turns out to be. This won&#8217;t be easy, given that we are tribal&#160;creatures and conflicted about the ideals ourselves. We often ignore the suffering of strangers, and even contribute to it, at least indirectly. How then, do we point machines in the direction of something better?<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">As for the &#8216;destination&#8217; problem, we might, by putting ourselves in the hands of these moral guides and gatekeepers, be sacrificing our own autonomy &#8211; an important part of what makes us human. Machines who are better than us at sticking to the moral high ground may be expected to discourage some of the lapses we presently take for granted. We might lose our freedom to discriminate in favour of our own communities, for example.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Loss of freedom to behave badly isn&#8217;t always a bad thing, of course: denying ourselves the freedom to put children to work in factories, or to smoke in restaurants are signs of progress. But are we ready for ethical silicon police limiting our options? They might be so good at doing it that we won&#8217;t notice them; but few of us are likely to welcome such a future.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">These issues might seem far-fetched, but they are to some extent already here. AI already has some input into how resources are used in our National Health Service (NHS) here in the UK, for example. If it was given a greater role, it might do so much more efficiently than humans can manage, and act in the interests of taxpayers and those who use the health system. However, we&#8217;d be depriving some humans (e.g. senior doctors) of the control they presently enjoy. Since we&#8217;d want to ensure that people are treated equally and that policies are fair, the goals of AI would need to be specified correctly.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">We have a new powerful technology to deal with- itself, literally, a new way of thinking. For our own safety, we need to point these new thinkers in the right direction, and get them to act well for us. It is not yet clear whether this is possible, but if it is, it will require a cooperative spirit, and a willingness to set aside self-interest.<br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\"><br></font></div><div><font size=\"3\">Both general intelligence and moral reasoning are often thought to be uniquely human capacities. But safety seems to require that we think of them as a package: if we are to give general intelligence to machines, we&#8217;ll need to give them moral authority, too. And where exactly would that leave human beings? All the more reason to think about the destination now, and to be careful about what we wish for.</font><br></div>",

A true Renaissance man, he embodied scientific spirit, artistic talent and humanist sensibilities. Five hundred years have passed since Leonardo died in his home at Chateau du Clos Luce, outside Tours, France. Yet far from fading into insignificance, his thinking has carried down the centuries and still surprises today.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>The Renaissance marked the transition from the 15th century to modernity and took place after the spread of the plague in the 14th century, which caused a global crisis resulting in some 200 million deaths across Europe and Asia. Today, the world is on the cusp of a climate crisis, which is predicted to cause widespread displacement, extinctions and death, if left unaddressed. Then, as now, radical solutions were called for to revolutionise the way people lived and safeguard humanity against catastrophe.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>Around 1486 &#8211; after a pestilence that killed half the population in Milan, Italy &#8211; Leonardo turned his thoughts to urban planning problems. Following a typical Renaissance trend, he began to work on an &#8216;ideal city&#8217; project, which &#8211; due to its excessive costs &#8211; would remain unfulfilled. Yet given that unsustainable urban models are a key cause of global climate change today, it&#8217;s only natural to wonder how Leonardo might have changed the shape of modem cities.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>Although the Renaissance is renowned as an era of incredible progress in art and architecture, it is rarely noted that the 15th century also marked the birth of urbanism as a true academic discipline. The rigour and method behind the conscious conception of a city had been largely missing in Western thought until the moment when prominent Renaissance men pushed forward large-scale urban projects in Italy, such as the reconfiguration of the town of Pienza and the expansion of the city of Ferrara. These works surely inspired Leonardo&#8217;s decision to rethink the design of medieval cities, with their winding and overcrowded streets and with houses piled against one another.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>It is not easy to identify a coordinated vision of Leonardo&#8217;s ideal city because of his disordered way of working with notes and sketches. But from the largest collection of Leonardo&#8217;s papers ever assembled, a series of innovative thoughts can be reconstructed regarding the foundation of a new city along the Ticino River, which runs from Switzerland into Italy and is 248 kilometres long. He designed the city for the easy transport of goods and clean urban spaces, and he wanted a comfortable and spacious city, with well-ordered streets and architecture. He recommended &#8216;high, strong walls&#8217;, with &#8216;towers and battlements of all necessary and pleasant beauty&#8217;.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>His plans for a modem and &#8216;rational&#8217; city were consistent with Renaissance ideals. But, in keeping with his personality, Leonardo included several innovations in his urban design. Leonardo wanted the city to be built on several levels, linked with vertical outdoor staircases. This design can be seen in some of today&#8217;s high-rise buildings but was unconventional at the time. Indeed, this idea of taking full advantage of the interior spaces wasn&#8217;t implemented until the 1920s and 1930s, with the birth of the Modernist movement.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>While in the upper layers of the city, people could walk undisturbed between elegant palaces and streets, the lower layer was the place for services, trade, transport and industry. But the true originality of Leonardo&#8217;s vision was its fusion of architecture and engineering. Leonardo designed extensive hydraulic plants to create artificial canals throughout the city. The canals, regulated by clocks and basins, were supposed to make it easier for boats to navigate inland. Leonardo also thought that the width of the streets ought to match the average height of the adjacent houses: a rule still followed in many contemporary cities across Italy, to allow access to sun and reduce the risk of damage from earthquakes.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>Although some of these features existed in Roman cities, before Leonardo&#8217;s drawings there had never been a multi-level, compact modem city which was thoroughly technically conceived. Indeed, it wasn&#8217;t until the 19th century that some of his ideas were applied. For example, the subdivision of the city by function- with services and infrastructures located in the lower levels and wide and well-ventilated boulevards and walkways above for residents &#8211; is an idea that can be found in Georges-Eugene Haussmann&#8217;s renovation of Paris under Emperor Napoleon III between 1853 and 1870.</span><br></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span><br></span></font></font></span></div><div><span><font size=\"3\"><font face=\"Josefin Sans, sans-serif\"><span>Today, Leonardo&#8217;s ideas are not simply valid, they actually suggest a way forward for urban planning. Many scholars think that the compact city, built upwards instead of outwards, integrated with nature (especially water systems), with efficient transport infrastructure, could help modern cities become more efficient and sustainable. This is yet another reason why Leonardo was aligned so closely with modern urban planning and centuries ahead of his time.</span><br></font></font></span></div>",

He was the seventh child of Raymond Moore and his wife Mary Baker. He studied at Castleford Grammar School from 1909 to 1915, where his early interest in art was encouraged by his teacher Alice Gostick. After leaving school, Moore hoped to become a sculptor, but instead he complied with his father&#8217;s wish that he train as a schoolteacher.&#160; He had to abandon his training in 1917 when he was sent to France to fight in the First World War.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>After the war, Moore enrolled at the Leeds School of Art, where he studied for two years. In his first year, he spent most of his time drawing. Although he wanted to study sculpture, no teacher was appointed until his second year. At the end of that year, he passed the sculpture examination and was awarded a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London. In September 1921, he moved to London and began three years of advanced study in sculpture.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Alongside the instruction he received at the Royal College, Moore visited many of the London museums, particularly the British Museum, which had a wide-ranging collection of ancient sculpture. During these visits, he discovered the power and beauty of ancient Egyptian and African sculpture. As he became increasingly interested in these &#8220;primitive&#8221; forms of art, he turned away from European sculptural traditions.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>After graduating, Moore spent the first six months of 1925 travelling in France. When he visited the Trocadero Museum in Paris, he was impressed by a cast of a Mayan sculpture of the rain spirit. It was a male reclining figure with its knees drawn up together, and its head at a right angle to its body. Moore became fascinated with this stone sculpture, which he thought had a power and originality that no other stone sculpture possessed. He himself started carving a variety of subjects in stone, including depictions of reclining women, mother-and-child groups, and masks.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Moore&#8217;s exceptional talent soon gained recognition, and in 1926 he started work as a sculpture instructor at the Royal College. In 1933, he became a member of a group of young artists called Unit One. The aim of the group was to convince the English public of the merits of the emerging international movement in modern art and architecture.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Around this time, Moore moved away from the human figure to experiment with abstract shapes. In 1931, he held an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in London. His work was enthusiastically welcomed by fellow sculptors, but the reviews in the press were extremely negative and turned Moore into a notorious figure. There were calls for his resignation from the Royal College, and the following year, when his contract expired, he left to start a sculpture department at the Chelsea School of Art in London.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Throughout the 1930s, Moore did not show any inclination to please the British public. He became interested in the paintings of the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, whose work inspired him to distort the human body in a radical way. At times, he seemed to abandon the human figure altogether. The pages of his sketchbooks from this period show his ideas for abstract sculptures that bore little resemblance to the human form.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In 1940, during the Second World War, Moore stopped teaching at the Chelsea School and moved to a farmhouse about 20 miles north of London. A shortage of materials forced him to focus on drawing. He did numerous small sketches of Londoners, later turning these ideas into large coloured drawings in his studio. In 1942, he returned to Castleford to make a series of sketches of the miners who worked there.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In 1944, Harlow, a town near London, offered Moore a commission for a sculpture depicting a family. The resulting work signifies a dramatic change in Moore&#8217;s style, away from the experimentation of the 1930s towards a more natural and humanistic subject matter. He did dozens of studies in clay for the sculpture, and these were cast in bronze and issued in editions of seven to nine copies each. In this way, Moore&#8217;s work became available to collectors all over the world. The boost to his income enabled him to take on ambitious projects and start working on the scale he felt his sculpture demanded.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Critics who had begun to think that Moore had become less revolutionary were proven wrong by the appearance, in 1950, of the first of Moore&#8217;s series of standing figures in bronze, with their harsh and angular pierced forms and distinct impression of menace. Moore also varied his subject matter in the 1950s with such works as Warrior with Shield and Falling Warrior. These were rare examples of Moore&#8217;s use of the male figure and owe something to his visit to Greece in 1951, when he had the opportunity to study ancient works of art.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In his final years, Moore created the Henry Moore Foundation to promote art appreciation and to display his work. Moore was the first modern English sculptor to achieve international critical acclaim and he is still regarded as one of the most important sculptors of the 20th century.</span><br></span></div>",

          "content": "<div><span><b>The Desolenator: producing clean water</b></span></div><div><span><b>A.</b> Travelling around Thailand in the 1990s, William Janssen was impressed with the basic rooftop solar heating systems that were on many homes, where energy from the sun was absorbed by a plate and then used to heat water for domestic use. Two decades later Janssen developed that basic idea he saw in Southeast Asia into a portable device that uses the power from the sun to purify water.<br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><b>B.</b>&#160;</span><span>The Desolenator operates as a mobile desalination unit that can take water from different places, such as the sea, rivers, boreholes and rain, and purify it for human consumption. It is particularly valuable in regions where natural groundwater reserves have been polluted, or where seawater is the only water source available.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span>Janssen saw that there was a need for a sustainable way to clean water is both the developing and the developed countries when he moved to the United Arab Emirates and saw large-scale water processing. &#8216;I was confronted with the enormous carbon footprint that the Gulf nations have because of all of the desalination that they do,&#8217; he says.</span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>C.</b>&#160;<span>The Desolenator can produce 15 litres of drinking water per day, enough to sustain a family for cooking and drinking. Its main selling point is that unlike standard desalination techniques, it doesn&#8217;t require a generated power supply: just sunlight. It measures 120 cm by 90 cm, and it easy to transport, thanks to its two wheels. Water enters through a pipe, and flows as a thin film between a sheet of double glazing and the surface of a solar panel, where it is heated by the sun. The warm water flows into a small boiler (heated by a solar-powered battery) where it is converted to steam. When the steam cools, it becomes distilled water. The device has a very simple filter to trap particles, and this can easily be shaken to remove them. There are two tubes for liquid coming out: one for the waste &#8211; salt from seawater, fluoride, etc. &#8211; and another for the distilled water. The performance of the unit is shown on an LCD screen and transmitted to the company which provides servicing when necessary.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>D.</b>&#160;</span><span>A recent analysis found that at least two-thirds of the world&#8217;s population lives with severe water scarcity for at least a month every year. Janssen says that by 2030 half of the world&#8217;s population will be living with water stress &#8211; where the demand exceeds the supply over a certain period of time. &#8216;It is really important that a sustainable solution is brought to the market that is able to help these people,&#8217; he says. Many countries &#8216;don&#8217;t have the money for desalination plants, which are very expensive to build. They don&#8217;t have the money to operate them, they are very maintenance intensive, and they don&#8217;t have the money to buy the diesel to run the desalination plants, so it is a really bad situation.&#8217;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>E.</b>&#160;</span><span>The device is aimed at a wide variety of users &#8211; from homeowners in the developing world who do not have a constant supply of water to people living off the grid in rural parts of the US. The first commercial versions of the Desolenator are expected to be in operation in India early next year, after field tests are carried out. The market for the self-sufficient devices in developing countries is twofold &#8211; those who cannot afford the money for the device outright and pay through microfinance, and middle-income homes that can lease their own equipment. &#8216;People in India don&#8217;t pay for a fridge outright; they pay for it over six months. They would put the Desolenator on their roof and hook it up to their municipal supply and they would get very reliable drinking water on a daily basis,&#8217; Janssen says. In the developed world, it is aimed at niche markets where tap water is unavailable &#8211; for camping, on boats, or for the military, for instance.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>F.</b>&#160;</span><span>Prices will vary according to where it is bought. In the developing world, the price will depend on what deal aid organisations can negotiate. In developed countries, it is likely to come in at $1,000 (&#163;685) a unit, said Janssen. &#8216;We are a venture with a social mission. We are aware that the product we have envisioned is mainly finding application in the developing world and humanitarian sector and that this is the way we will proceed. We do realise, though, that to be a viable company there is a bottom line to keep in mind,&#8217; he says.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>G.</b>&#160;</span><span>The company itself is based at Imperial College London, although Janssen, its chief executive, still lives in the UAE. It has raised &#163;340,000 in funding so far. Within two years, he says, the company aims to be selling 1,000 units a month, mainly in the humanitarian field. They are expected to be sold in areas such as Australia, northern Chile, Peru, Texas and California.</span></div>",

          "content": "<div><b>Why fairy tales are really scary tales</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><span><span><i>Some people think that fairy tales are just stories to amuse children, but their universal and enduring appeal may be due to more serious reasons</i></span></span><b><br></b></div><div><span><span><i><br></i></span></span></div><div><span><span>People of every culture tell each other fairy tales but the same story often takes a variety of forms in different parts of the world. In the story of Little Red Riding Hood that European children are familiar with, a young girl on the way to see her grandmother meets a wolf and tells him where she is going. The wolf runs on ahead and disposes of the grandmother, then gets into bed dressed in the grandmother&#8217;s clothes to wait for Little Red Riding Hood. You may think you know the story &#8211; but which version? In some versions, the wolf swallows up the grandmother, while in others it locks her in a cupboard. In some stories Red Riding Hood gets the better of the wolf on her own, while in others a hunter or a woodcutter hears her cries and comes to her rescue.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>The universal appeal of these tales is frequently attributed to the idea that they contain cautionary messages: in the case of Little Red Riding Hood, to listen to your mother, and avoid talking to strangers. &#8216;It might be what we find interesting about this story is that it&#8217;s got this survival-relevant information in it,&#8217; says anthropologist Jamie Tehrani at Durham University in the UK. But his research suggests otherwise. &#8216;We have this huge gap in our knowledge about the history and prehistory of storytelling, despite the fact that we know this genre is an incredibly ancient one,&#8217; he says. That hasn&#8217;t stopped anthropologists, folklorists* and other academics devising theories to explain the importance of fairy tales in human society. Now Tehrani has found a way to test these ideas, borrowing a technique from evolutionary biologists.</span></span><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>To work out the evolutionary history, development and relationships among groups of organisms, biologists compare the characteristics of living species in a process called &#8216;phylogenetic analysis&#8217;. Tehrani has used the same approach to compare related versions of fairy tales to discover how they have evolved and which elements have survived longest.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Tehrani&#8217;s analysis focused on Little Red Riding Hood in its many forms, which include another Western fairy tale known as The Wolf and the Kids. Checking for variants of these two tales and similar stories from Africa, East Asia and other regions, he ended up with 58 stories recorded from oral traditions. Once his phylogenetic analysis had established that they were indeed related, he used the same methods to explore how they have developed and altered over time.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>First he tested some assumptions about which aspects of the story alter least as it evolves, indicating their importance. Folklorists believe that what happens in a story is more central to the story than the characters in it &#8211; that visiting a relative, only to be met by a scary animal in disguise, is more fundamental than whether the visitor is a little girl or three siblings, or the animal is a tiger instead of a wolf.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>However, Tehrani found no significant difference in the rate of evolution of incidents compared with that of characters. &#8216;Certain episodes are very stable because they are crucial to the story, but there are lots of other details that can evolve quite freely,&#8217; he says. Neither did his analysis support the theory that the central section of a story is the most conserved part. He found no significant difference in the flexibility of events there compared with the beginning or the end.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>But the really big surprise came when he looked at the cautionary elements of the story. &#8216;Studies on hunter-gatherer folk tales suggest that these narratives include really important information about the environment and the possible dangers that may be faced there &#8211; stuff that&#8217;s relevant to survival,&#8217; he says. Yet in his analysis such elements were just as flexible as seemingly trivial details. What, then, is important enough to be reproduced from generation to generation?<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>The answer, it would appear, is fear &#8211; blood-thirsty and gruesome aspects of the story, such as the eating of the grandmother by the wolf, turned out to be the best preserved of all. Why are these details retained by generations of storytellers, when other features are not? Tehrani has an idea: &#8216;In an oral context, a story won&#8217;t survive because of one great teller. It also needs to be interesting when it&#8217;s told by someone who&#8217;s not necessarily a great storyteller.&#8217; Maybe being swallowed whole by a wolf, then cut out of its stomach alive is so gripping that it helps the story remain popular, no matter how badly it&#8217;s told.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Jack Zipes at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, is unconvinced by Tehrani&#8217;s views on fairy tales. &#8216;Even if they&#8217;re gruesome, they won&#8217;t stick unless they matter,&#8217; he says. He believes the perennial theme of women as victims in stories like Little Red Riding Hood explains why they continue to feel relevant. But Tehrani points out that although this is often the case in Western versions, it is not always true elsewhere. In Chinese and Japanese versions, often known as The Tiger Grandmother, the villain is a woman, and in both Iran and Nigeria, the victim is a boy.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Mathias Clasen at Aarhus University in Denmark isn&#8217;t surprised by Tehrani&#8217;s findings. &#8216;Habits and morals change, but the things that scare us, and the fact that we seek out entertainment that&#8217;s designed to scare us &#8211; those are constant,&#8217; he says. Clasen believes that scary stories teach us what it feels like to be afraid without having to experience real danger, and so build up resistance to negative emotions.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div>--</div><div><br></div><div>*Folklorists: those who study traditional stories<br></div>",

The Royal Exchange, the Guildhall and St. Paul&#8217;s Cathedral, all built during the Middle Ages, were also all totally destroyed. Although the verified death toll was only six people, it is unknown how many people died in the Great Fire of London, because many more died through indirect causes. The financial losses caused by the fire were estimated to be &#163;10 million, at a time when London&#8217;s annual income was only &#163;12,000. Many people were financially ruined and debtors&#8217; prisons became over-crowded.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph B</b></span><br></span></div><div><span><span>The Great Fire of London started on Sunday, 2 September 1666 in a baker&#8217;s shop in Pudding Lane, belonging to Thomas Farynor. Although he claimed to have extinguished the fire, three hours later, at 1 a.m., his house was a blazing inferno. It is not certain how the fire actually began, but it is likely that it may have been caused by a spark from Farynor&#8217;s oven falling onto a pile of fuel nearby. In 1979, archaeologists excavated the remains of a burnt out shop on Pudding Lane that was very close to the bakery where the fire started. In the cellar, they found the charred remnants of 20 barrels of pitch. Pitch burns very easily and would have helped to spread the fire.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph C</b></span><br></span></div><div><span><span>The fire spread quickly down Pudding Lane and carried on down Fish Hill and towards the Thames. The fire continued to spread rapidly, helped by a strong wind from the east. When it reached the Thames, it hit warehouses that were stocked with combustible products, such as oil and rope. Fortunately, the fire could not spread south of the river, because a previous blaze in 1633 had already wrecked a section of London Bridge. As the fire was spreading so quickly, most Londoners concentrated on escaping rather than fighting the fire.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph D</b></span><br></span></div><div><span><span>In the 17th century, people were not as aware of the dangers of fire as they are today. Buildings were made of timber covered in pitch and tightly packed together. The design of buildings meant flames could easily spread from building to building. Following a long, dry summer, the city was suffering a drought; water was scarce and the wooden houses had dried out, making them easier to burn.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph E</b></span><br></span></div><div><span><span>Samuel Pepys, a diarist of the period and Clerk to the Royal Navy, observed the fire and recommended to the King that buildings should be pulled down, as it could be the only way to stop the fire. The Mayor made the order to pull down burning houses using fire hooks, but the fire continued to spread. Pepys then spoke to the Admiral of the Navy and they agreed that they should blow up houses in the path of the fire. The hope was that by doing this, they would create a space to stop the fire spreading from house to house. The Navy carried out the request and by the next morning, the fire has been successfully stopped.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph F</b></span><br></span></div><div><span><span>London had to be almost totally reconstructed and many people went to the fields outside London. They stayed there for many days, sheltering in tents and shacks and some people were forced to live in this way for months and even years. Throughout 1667, people cleared rubble and surveyed the burnt area. Much time was spent planning new street layouts and drawing up new building regulations. Public buildings were paid for with money from a new coal tax, but by the end of the year only 150 new houses had been built. The new regulations were designed to prevent such a disaster happening again. Houses now had to be faced in brick instead of wood. Some streets were widened and two new streets were created. Pavements and new sewers were laid, and London&#8217;s quaysides were improved. Initially, however, only temporary buildings were erected that were ill-equipped, and this enabled the plague, which was common in London at that time, to spread easily. Many people died from this and the harsh winter that followed the fire.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><b><span>Paragraph G</span><br></b></span></div><div><span><span>In 1666, there was no organised fire brigade. Fire fighting was very basic with little skill or knowledge involved. Leather buckets, axes and water squirts were used to fight the fire, but they had little effect. As a result of the Great Fire of London, early fire brigades were formed by insurance companies. Building insurance was very profitable and many more insurance companies were set up, establishing their own fire brigades. These brigades were sent to insured properties if a fire occurred to minimise damage and cost. Firemarks were used to identify - and advertise - different insurance companies. They were placed on the outside of an insured building and brigades would use them to determine whether a building was insured by them. If a building was on fire, several brigades would attend. If they did not see their specific firemark attached to the building, they would leave the property to burn. Some old firemarks can still be seen on London buildings today. Also, fire fighters wore uniforms to distinguish themselves from rival insurance brigades. Although this was a step in the right direction, fire fighters received little training and the equipment used remained very basic.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Pitch &#8211; A thick liquid made from petroleum or coal tar.</div></span></span></div>",

          "content": "<div><b>A New Threat in Yellowstone</b></div><div><span><span>It has long been known that Yellowstone National Park lies over an enormous supervolcano. The term &#8216;supervolcano&#8217; implies a volcanic centre that has had an eruption of magnitude 8 on the Volcano Explosivity Index (VEI), meaning the measured deposits for that eruption are greater than 1,000 cubic kilometres. This sounds worrying and Professor George Peters details the possible results if something were to happen. &#8220;A major eruption would obliterate the surroundings within a radius of hundreds of kilometres, and cover the rest of the United States and Canada with multiple inches of ash. This would shut down agriculture and cause global climate cooling for as long as a decade.&#8221; To calm everyone down, geologist, Tony Masters, explains there is little to fear today. &#8220;All VEI 8 eruptions, including the last at Yellowstone, occurred tens of thousands to millions of years ago. Another eruption could occur, but it is very unlikely to happen in the next million years or so.&#8221;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Yellowstone is no stranger to controversy. There was a previous media accusation that US Geological Survey (USGS) geologists had not done their work properly and that the identification of Yellowstone as a supervolcano was not done until scientists looked at photographs of Yellowstone from space. The Yellowstone scientists denied this. Spokesman Alice Wheeler clarifies their position. &#8220;The scientist who first identified the three Yellowstone calderas was from the USGS and he told the world about the great eruptions that formed them. He traced out the caldera boundaries through old fashioned field work, walking around with a hammer and hand lens and looking carefully at the rocks and their distributions.&#8221; The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) also agreed. Stan Forsyth, their spokesman, explains. &#8220;Several authors have written that these large calderas in Yellowstone were discovered from space, but we suspect that the rumour probably got started because initial field work that identified them was partly funded by NASA.&#8221;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>A new problem in Yellowstone is that the supervolcano has now been discovered to be larger than originally thought and this has made people feel more nervous. Seismologists at the University of Utah have worked with several other institutions to create an image of the Yellowstone magma reservoir using a technique called seismic tomography. Masters student, Julia Grey, explains the results. &#8220;By looking closely at data from thousands of earthquakes, we have discovered that there are two magma reservoirs, one shallow and one deep, and that they are much larger than originally believed. The shallow one was previously known about to us, but the deeper one is a new finding.&#8221;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>To create an image of this second magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone, the research teams reviewed data from thousands of earthquakes. Seismic waves travel slower through hot, partially molten rock and faster in cold, solid rock. The researchers made a map of the locations where seismic waves travel more slowly, which provided a sub-surface image of the hot or partially molten bodies in the crust beneath Yellowstone. The deeper magma storage region extends from 20 to 50 kilometres depth, contains about 2 per cent melt, and is about 4.5 times larger than the shallow magma body. The shallower magma storage region is about 90 kilometres long, extends from 5 to 17 kilometres depth,&#160;</span></span><span>and is 2.5 times larger than a prior, less accurate, study indicated. This magma reservoir contains between about 5 to 15 per cent molten rock. Although this is the crustal magma storage region that has fuelled Yellowstone&#8217;s past volcanic activity, magma typically does not erupt unless it has greater than 50 per cent melt.</span><span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span>The US and world media were quick to dramatise the finding and exaggerate the threat that these findings represent. Yellowstone park scientist, Amy Brent, has calming words. &#8220;These findings do not increase the assessment of volcanic hazard for Yellowstone. The inferred magma storage region is no larger than we already knew. The research simply makes a better image of the magmatic system. Simply, we have more key information about how the Yellowstone volcano works.&#8221;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Many independent reports back up Brent&#8217;s comments and have shown that the Yellowstone area has been on a long cycle of periodic eruptions. Eruptions are extremely infrequent in supervolcanos, and eventually the cycle ends in their deaths. US government geologist, Andrea Haller, explains the state of the Yellowstone supervolcano. &#8220;By investigating the patterns of behaviour in two previously completed caldera cycles, we can suggest that the current activity of Yellowstone is on the dying cycle.&#8221; This is based on comparisons with other supervolcanos. Scientists know the behaviour of the past and they know at what comparative stage Yellowstone is right now. It is believed that Yellowstone is currently on a third and dying cycle. This can be concluded by the fact that dying volcanos produce less fresh molten material from the Earth&#8217;s crust. Haller continues. &#8220;We&#8217;ve observed a lot of material in the magma chambers that represent recycled volcanic rocks, which were once buried inside of calderas and are now getting reused. Yellowstone has erupted enough of this material already to suggest that the future melting potential of the crust is getting exhausted.&#8221;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Whatever the truth about Yellowstone, it seems that during the lives of most people, the geological status of Yellowstone can still prove hazardous. The park has often been closed due to volcanic activity in the past and this is likely to happen again before the volcano becomes harmless.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Caldera &#8211; an enormous volcano crater.</div><div>Magma &#8211; melted rock.</div></span></span></div>",

          "content": "<div><b>The Psychology of Wealth</b><br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>What stops people from succeeding financially and having on-going prosperity in their life? The answer is generally focused around the belief that financial success is not a possibility. There are many people who have barriers of which they are unaware that prevent them from having the wealth and abundance that they deserve.<br></div><div><br></div><div>At a conscious level, most people think they are doing everything possible to achieve their goals. However, there still might be some unwitting part of them that does not believe they can obtain success. The more that unconscious part is avoided, the more a person will be blocked in their everyday life. Another problem is that, instead of focusing on all the possible ways to get rich, many people have an obsession about what they do not have. An interesting pattern develops in which they can become angry or resentful over their situation and this in turn can limit these people in their lives more and more. Individuals would find it so much easier to get ahead in life with a peaceful state of mind, rather than an angry or resentful one.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A first step in understanding the unconscious patterning of a person&#8217;s financial situation is to explore the deeper nature of how they represent money. For example, a person with money issues may have had parents who lived in poverty, and they subsequently formed a &#8216;Depression Era&#8217; mentality. An unconscious belief can develop that he or she will always have to struggle financially, because that is what their parents did. Alternatively, the person might have had a parent tell them over and over again that they will never be successful, and eventually they begin to believe it.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It is very common for children to unconsciously form limiting beliefs around money at an early age. In the field of Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP), these types of limiting beliefs are referred to as &#8216;imprints.&#8217; An imprint is basically a memory that is formed at an early age, and can serve as a root for both the limiting and empowering beliefs that people form as children. Some of the beliefs that people may develop at early ages are not always healthy, and are created as a result of a traumatic or confusing experience that they have forgotten. How we unconsciously and consciously view the world in terms of money is often based on such beliefs.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A primary and fundamental psychological difference between those who do well financially and those who do not revolves around beliefs. For example, many people do not even view financial success as an option. They do not have the capability to open themselves up to all of the possibilities that are available for achieving prosperity and they will nearly always get stuck in a monthly routine, so that they are unwilling to take risks or try something different, because they are afraid that they will end up being even worse off than before.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another issue can be that people become over-absorbed with the idea of making money and this can be extremely unhealthy. Money does not determine who you are; it&#8217;s simply a resource. There is a term called &#8216;affluenza,&#8217; which has been defined as &#8220;a painful, contagious, socially transmitted condition of overload, debt, anxiety and waste resulting from the dogged pursuit of more.&#8221; Affluenza is an unsustainable and seriously unhealthy addiction to personal and societal economic growth. It is most acute in those who inherit wealth and seem to have no purpose or direction. For those with wealth or for those who desire it more than anything, abandoning the urge for more can often be the key to being more successful, and certainly happier. Once people stop equating their self-worth with money, then the doors of possibility can swing open for them, because they are willing to try more things. Once they start feeling better about themselves, they become less fearful and can be open to trying something completely different.<br></div><div><br></div><div>So, can money make people happy? Research shows that it does up to a point, after which there are diminishing returns, so that the extremely wealthy are no happier than the comfortably well off. Rich nations are generally happier than poor ones, but the relationship is far from consistent; other factors like political stability, freedom and security also play a part. Research likewise shows that the money- happiness connection seems to be stronger for people paid hourly than those on a salary. This is presumably because salaried people can more easily compensate with career satisfaction. Money can also impair the ability to enjoy the simple things in life, which rather offsets the happiness that wealth brings.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Money can also impair people&#8217;s satisfaction in their play and humanitarian works. When someone has done something out of the goodness of their heart, they can be insulted by offers of payment. Experiments show that paying people derisory amounts of money for their work results in them enjoying it less and doing it less well than if they had no pay at all. The capacity for a reward to undermine a person&#8217;s intrinsic pleasure in work performance has been demonstrated neurologically.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, people need to realise that their own attitudes to wealth can affect their chances of acquiring both money and happiness. As a person begins to embrace self worth and open himself or herself up to the idea of what is possible, he or she will attract wealth and prosperity into their life. The outer world is truly a reflection of people&#8217;s inner worlds. If someone feels good inside, generally it will show on the outside and they will draw positive experiences into their life.<br></div>",

They are found from India, throughout southeast Asia and New Guinea, across to northern Australia, Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. They are most commonly seen in tidal reaches, as this usually gives them the combination of safety and significant access to food. In spite of their name, salt-water crocodiles also occur in freshwater lagoons, rivers, and swamps hundreds of kilometres inland from the coast.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b><br></div><div>Adult males are on average 5 metres long and weigh more than 450 kilograms, whereas females are much smaller, generally around 3 metres long and up to 150 kilograms. There are uncommon records of male salt-water crocodiles reaching more than 7 metres in length and 1000 kilograms in weight. The upper body is grey, brown or almost black above, with irregular darker mottling; they are generally whitish on the underside. The snout of an adult is broad and granular; the distance from the tip to the centre of the eyes is less than twice the width of the head at eye level. The tail is highly muscular and is the main propulsion mechanism used in the water. Juveniles are generally pale tan in colour, with black stripes and spots on the body and tail.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b><br></div><div>The wet season is the time that the salt-water crocodile nests. Courtship occurs 4 to 6 weeks before nesting and continues through the nesting period. Large males control a territory through aggression, and consequently fertilise most reproductively active females within it. During courting, the females approach the males and an elaborate process of swimming together, body contact and rubbing follows. The salt-water crocodile is a mound nester, preferring areas with tall vegetation and permanent water close by. One clutch with an average of 52 to 60 eggs is laid per season. Eggs are ovoid in shape and measure approximately 8 centimetres in length, 5 centimetres in width and weigh 113 grams. Incubation time varies between 65 and 114 days, with the adult female remaining nearby to defend the nest throughout this period. The temperature of the nest is determined by heat generated within the nest and the external ambient temperature, and this is important as the temperature of the nest determines the sex of the hatchlings. Males are produced between 31 to 33 degrees Celsius and females dominate the ratios above and below these temperatures. Once the eggs hatch, the adult female excavates the nest after hearing the calls of the hatchlings and carries them to the water<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b><br></div><div>Salt-water crocodiles use the water, sun and shade to maintain their preferred body temperature of 30 to 33 degrees Celsius. When basking, they orientate their bodies to ensure the maximum surface area is exposed to the sun. All crocodiles are unable to sweat. To avoid over-heating, they may return to the water or lie with their jaws agape, allowing cool air to circulate over the skin in their mouths. This process of heating and cooling their bodies is called thermoregulation and is crucial for many bodily functions, including digestion and locomotion, and ultimately for their survival. Often observed basking on the banks of watercourses where they are generally inactive, salt-water crocodiles are less likely to be seen when they are in the water.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b><br></div><div>Salt-water crocodiles are one of the few reptiles to have a four-chambered heart, like mammals. They can also stay underwater for extended periods of time, because they have the ability to slow their heart rate, allowing them to hold their breath. A particular feature of salt-water crocodiles is their inability to maintain strenuous activity for extended periods of time and they can easily become exhausted while capturing prey or fighting other crocodiles. Extreme exertion is carried out anaerobically and must be followed by a period of rest so that the oxygen debt can be repaid to their muscles. One result of this anaerobic activity is a build-up of lactic acid in the blood. Although crocodiles can withstand higher levels of blood acidity than other animals, it can sometimes be fatal.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b><br></div><div>Until 1974, salt-water crocodiles were hunted to the brink of extinction for their skins. In Australia&#8217;s Northern Territory for example, as few as 3000 salt-water crocodiles were present when hunting ceased. Today, the total Australian population is currently estimated to be approximately a hundred thousand salt-water crocodiles, although some biologists estimate the population is even higher. It is estimated that less than one per cent of eggs laid by salt-water crocodiles hatch and survive to adulthood, and overheating, flooding and predation claim a high proportion of unhatched embryos. From the small numbers that do hatch, more than half die in their first year of life, mainly from predation by birds of prey, fish, snake-necked turtles and other crocodiles. Once they have reached maturity, their only enemies are each other and humans. Habitat destruction by people is now considered a major threat to Australian salt-water crocodiles.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b><br></div><div>Australia is one of the very few places in the world where salt-water crocodiles have a good chance of survival in the wild. As apex predators, they are an important part of the food chain and as such cull vulnerable prey, such as the old, injured, sick, or very young, leaving more food for the survival and prosperity of healthy prey animals. This helps keep the Australian wetland environments healthy and stable, and so protecting the &#8216;saltie&#8217; is vitally important. This means Australians have a responsibility to conserve and manage the country&#8217;s crocodile populations carefully.<br></div>",

Born in Penzance in 1778, Davy attended a local Grammar School before returning to his home town as an apothecary&#8217;s apprentice. In 1798, he moved to Bristol to work at Thomas Beddoes&#8217;s Pneumatic Institution where he discovered the physiological effects of nitrous oxide while exploring the applications of various other gases.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>After performing his experiments on nitrous oxide, he was later in 1798 named chemical superintendent to the Institute of Science, a foundation in London that investigated the medical benefits of various gases. He published his results in 1800, which earned him the opportunity to start lecturing at the new Royal Institution of Great Britain in the same year. His lectures were surprisingly successful, even beyond narrow scientific circles, and enabled him to meet and befriend some of the most important figures of the day.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Davy moved to London in 1801 to work at the Royal Institution as Assistant Lecturer. He proved to be an extremely gifted lecturer and was promoted to Professor of Chemistry the following year. Davy was famous for his lectures, which were so popular that a one-way system was put in place in Albemarle Street to cope with the traffic, but he was also interested in pursuing chemical research in the Royal Institution laboratories. Much of Davy&#8217;s important work in the first decade of the nineteenth century focused on the relationship between chemistry and electricity. Having concluded that electrolytic cells generated electrical energy through a chemical process, he speculated that electrolysis might be used to decompose substances into their elements. Although he overestimated the ability of electrolysis, he did successfully isolate sodium and potassium, and was the first to discover boron, hydrogen telluride, and hydrogen phosphide. He was later instrumental in identifying other elements such as chlorine and iodine, which had been discovered, but were thought to be compounds.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In 1812, Davy was knighted and married a wealthy widow, Jane Apreece, who gave him a son, Jack, in the same year. He then retired from lecturing, although not from research. His last important act at the Royal Institution, of which he remained honorary professor, was to interview the young Michael Faraday, later to become one of England&#8217;s great scientists, who became laboratory assistant there in 1813 and accompanied Davy on a European tour. Davy&#8217;s fame was such that he was granted special permission to travel to the continent to meet with other famous scientists. However, the political situation was fragile and the trip had to be cut short in 1815 on Napoleon&#8217;s escape from Elba. With the aid of a small portable laboratory and of various institutions in France and Italy, he conducted further investigations on various compounds of iodine and chlorine. He also analysed many specimens of classical pigments and proved that diamond is a form of carbon.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In 1819, by order of the Society for Preventing Accidents in Mines, Davy studied the conditions under which mixtures of firedamp and air explode. This led to the invention of the helmet lamp and to subsequent researches on flame, for which he received the Rumford medals from the Royal Society.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>After this, Davy examined various magnetic phenomena caused by electricity and electrochemical methods and explored whether they, in combination with iron and zinc plates, could prevent saltwater corrosion to the copper sheathing on ships. Though the protective principles were made clear, considerable fouling still occurred, and the method&#8217;s failure greatly vexed him.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Davy&#8217;s health was by then failing rapidly. In 1827, he departed for Europe and, in the summer, was forced to resign the presidency of the Royal Society. Having to forgo business and field sports, Davy wrote a book on fishing (something he&#8217;d always enjoyed) in the same year that contained engravings from his own drawings. After a last, short visit to England, he returned to Italy, settling in Rome in February 1829. Though partly paralysed from a stroke, he spent his last months writing a series of dialogues, which were later released posthumously. While touring in 1829, Davy suffered a further severe stroke and died in Geneva in 1829. Davy had wished to be buried where he died, but had also wanted the burial deferred in case he was only comatose. However, the laws of Geneva did not allow any delay and it was performed a few days later.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div>One of Davy&#8217;s creations that we are in contact nearly every day is the light bulb, which he invented in 1801. He was experimenting with electricity around 1800 when he invented an electric battery. When he later connected wires to his battery and a piece of carbon, the carbon glowed, producing light, which is now called an electric arc. It was neither sufficiently bright nor long lasting enough to be of practical use, but it did demonstrate the principle. By 1806, he was able to demonstrate a much more powerful form of electric lighting to the Royal Society in London. This was soon developed into the basic light bulb that we know today, which is a glass envelope containing a combination of inert gases at low pressure. The current enters through a contact at the bottom end, just below the screw cap. Connecting wires come up through a glass fuse enclosure. From this, a filament comes up, surrounded by support wires and the electric arc is derived from this.<span><span><br></span></span></div>",

          "content": "<div><span><b>The Vaccination Debate</b></span></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span><span>Disputes over vaccination have taken place for almost eighty years, since vaccinations were introduced. Despite scientific consensus that recommended vaccines are safe and effective, scares regarding their safety still occur today, resulting in regular disease outbreaks and deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Parental refusal of vaccines, or &#8216;vaccine hesitancy&#8217; as it is sometimes called, is therefore a growing concern for the increased occurrence of vaccine preventable diseases in children and the reasons for this vary widely. Parental concerns about vaccines in each category lead to a wide spectrum of decisions varying from parents completely refusing all vaccinations to only delaying vaccinations, so that they are more spread out. A large subset of parents who allow their children to be vaccinated, have also admitted to being worried and having questions about the vaccinations. For this reason, it can be helpful for pharmacists and other healthcare providers to understand the cited reasons for hesitancy, so they are better prepared to educate their patients&#8217; families. Education is a key element in equipping parents with the necessary information, so that they can make responsible immunisation decisions for their children.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In the United States, all fifty states require that children be vaccinated in order to go to public school. There are some variations in which immunisations are required and when, but throughout the U.S., there is an expectation that going to school means getting shots. However, in all fifty states, there are ways to get out of being vaccinated, usually by saying that vaccination goes against people&#8217;s individual convictions. However, a significant underlying reason why parents are refusing is that they just don&#8217;t think vaccines are necessary. In essence, we are victims of our own success. Vaccines have done such a good job that many people no longer remember the horrific range of vaccine-preventable diseases</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Another problem is that people who choose not to vaccinate often live in the same communities. This isn&#8217;t surprising, given that people&#8217;s social networks influence their choices. However, when groups of unimmunised people live together, it completely disrupts the whole concept of herd immunity. Vaccine-preventable diseases can easily take root and spread. While it&#8217;s important that parents in general have the right to choose whether or not their child gets a medical treatment &#8211; and vaccines are a medical treatment &#8211; the vaccination choice is fundamentally different in that it affects not just the child, but also the entire community. Choosing not to vaccinate is dangerous for the child and it&#8217;s dangerous for everyone around that child. Individual beliefs should not give anyone the right to put the health of others at risk.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Some parents believe that vaccines can cause the diseases that they are meant to prevent. Properly formulated vaccines cannot do this, however, as they either use weakened or inactive viruses. These types of vaccine help people develop immunity by imitating an infection. The type of infection a vaccine causes, however, does not cause illness, but it does cause the immune system to produce&#160;</span></span><span>antibodies. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection can cause minor symptoms, such as fever, but such minor symptoms are normal and should be expected as the body builds immunity. Once the imitation infection goes away, the body is left with a supply of &#8216;memory&#8217; cells that will remember how to fight that disease in the future. However, as it typically takes a few weeks for the body to produce antibodies, it is possible that a person who was infected with a disease just before or just after vaccination could develop symptoms and get the disease, because the vaccine had not had enough time to provide protection.</span><span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span>The informative interaction between health providers and doubtful parents is vital for ensuring the protection of children through vaccination, but these interactions can sometimes be difficult for the health providers. Research has shown that most GP&#8217;s and immunising nurses found discussions with parents who decline to vaccinate their children to be challenging and that they felt that these parents cast doubt on their integrity. These encounters also stimulated strong internal conflict; many providers felt their professional obligations to the child and the community conflicted with the primarily bureaucratic function of exempting parents from complying with the recommended immunisation schedule. A number of professionals also can begrudge being called upon to sign exemption forms at all.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>If pharmacists and other health care providers are able to understand the main concerns parents have about vaccinating their children, they can be better prepared to have informative conversations about immunisations and they will also be able to provide the information parents need to make the bestinformed decisions for their children. Parents who are hesitant to vaccinate or who refuse vaccines care about their children and want to do what they can to protect them, just like any other parent. It is important for practitioners to have open and frank conversations with their patients and their families so that the families will understand the benefits of vaccination without undergoing judgement for having questions about their child&#8217;s healthcare.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>The education patients have been exposed to has resulted in modest improvement in terms of affecting parents&#8217; attitudes about immunisation, but the tools healthcare providers should use for this have not been fully discovered. Understanding the source of parents&#8217; questions can equip pharmacists, physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers to speak with patients on a more relatable level and to speak in ways that parents value the most. All healthcare workers should make an effort to know about the recommended vaccines and to understand why those immunisations are recommended. This information will allow families to have face-to-face access to reliable information that can help them to make the best decisions for the society they live in.</span><br></span></div>",

It is also one of the most fragile ecosystems on Earth. It hardly ever rains there, and the only year-round source of water is located tens of metres below the surface. This is why the huarango tree is so suited to life there: it has the longest roots of any tree in the world. They stretch down 50-80 metres and, as well as sucking up water for the tree, they bring it into the higher subsoil, creating a water source for other plant life.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Dr David Beresford-Jones, archaeobotanist at Cambridge University, has been studying the role of the huarango tree in landscape change in the Lower Ica Valley in southern Peru. He believes the huarango was key to the ancient people&#8217;s diet and, because it could reach deep water sources, it allowed local people to withstand years of drought when their other crops failed. But over the centuries huarango trees were gradually replaced with crops. Cutting down native woodland leads to erosion, as there is nothing to keep the soil in place. So when the huarangos go, the land turns into a desert. Nothing grows at all in the Lower Ica Valley now.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>For centuries the huarango tree was vital to the people of the neighbouring Middle Ica Valley too. They grew vegetables under it and ate products made from its seed pods. Its leaves and bark were used for herbal remedies, while its branches were used for charcoal for cooking and heating, and its trunk was used to build houses. But now it is disappearing rapidly. The majority of the huarango forests in the valley have already been cleared for fuel and agriculture &#8211; initially, these were smallholdings, but now they&#8217;re huge farms producing crops for the international market.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&#8216;Of the forests that were here 1,000 years ago, 99 per cent have already gone,&#8217; says botanist Oliver Whaley from Kew Gardens in London, who, together with ethnobotanist Dr William Milliken, is running a pioneering project to protect and restore the rapidly disappearing habitat. In order to succeed, Whaley needs to get the local people on board, and that has meant overcoming local prejudices. &#8216;Increasingly aspirational communities think that if you plant food trees in your home or street, it shows you are poor, and still need to grow your own food,&#8217; he says. In order to stop the Middle Ica Valley going the same way as the Lower Ica Valley, Whaley is encouraging locals to love the huarangos again. &#8216;It&#8217;s a process of cultural resuscitation,&#8217; he says. He has already set up a huarango festival to reinstate a sense of pride in their eco-heritage, and has helped local schoolchildren plant thousands of trees.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&#8216;In order to get people interested in habitat restoration, you need to plant a tree that is useful to them,&#8217; says Whaley. So, he has been working with local families to attempt to create a sustainable income from the huarangos by turning their products into foodstuffs. &#8216;Boil up the beans and you get this thick brown syrup like molasses. You can also use it in drinks, soups or stews.&#8217; The pods can be ground into flour to make cakes, and the seeds roasted into a sweet, chocolatey &#8216;coffee&#8217;. &#8216;It&#8217;s packed full of vitamins and minerals,&#8217; Whaley says.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>And some farmers are already planting huarangos. Alberto Benevides, owner of Ica Valley&#8217;s only certified organic farm, which Whaley helped set up, has been planting the tree for 13 years. He produces syrup and flour, and sells these products at an organic farmers&#8217; market in Lima. His farm is relatively small and doesn&#8217;t yet provide him with enough to live on, but he hopes this will change. &#8216;The organic market is growing rapidly in Peru,&#8217; Benevides says. &#8216;I am investing in the future.&#8217;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>But even if Whaley can convince the local people to fall in love with the huarango again, there is still the threat of the larger farms. Some of these cut across the forests and break up the corridors that allow the essential movement of mammals, birds and pollen up and down the narrow forest strip. In the hope of counteracting this, he&#8217;s persuading farmers to let him plant forest corridors on their land. He believes the extra woodland will also benefit the farms by reducing their water usage through a lowering of evaporation and providing a refuge for bio-control insects.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><br></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&#8216;If we can record biodiversity and see how it all works, then we&#8217;re in a good position to move on from there. Desert habitats can reduce down to very little,&#8217; Whaley explains. &#8216;It&#8217;s not like a rainforest that needs to have this huge expanse. Life has always been confined to corridors and islands here. If you just have a few trees left, the population can grow up quickly because it&#8217;s used to exploiting water when it arrives.&#8217; He sees his project as a model that has the potential to be rolled out across other arid areas around the world. &#8216;If we can do it here, in the most fragile system on Earth, then that&#8217;s a real message of hope for lots of places, including Africa, where there is drought and they just can&#8217;t afford to wait for rain.&#8217;</span></p><div><span><br></span></div></span></div>",

This small volcanic island is mountainous, with steep rocky slopes and deep, wooded ravines, rising to 1,487 metres at its highest peak. It is also home to the best known of the world&#8217;s whistle &#8216;languages&#8217;, a means of transmitting information over long distances which is perfectly adapted to the extreme terrain of the island.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>This &#8216;language&#8217;, known as &#8216;Silbo&#8217; or &#8216;Silbo Gomero&#8217; &#8212; from the Spanish word for &#8216;whistle&#8217; &#8212; is now shedding light on the language&#8212;processing abilities of the human brain, according to scientists. Researchers say that Silbo activates parts of the brain normally associated with spoken language, suggesting that the brain is remarkably flexible in its ability to interpret sounds as language.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>&#8216;Science has developed the idea of brain areas that are dedicated to language, and we are starting to understand the scope of signals that can be recognised as language,&#8217; says David Corina, co-author of a recent study and associate professor of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Silbo is a substitute for Spanish, with individual words receded into whistles which have high- and low-frequency tones. A whistler &#8212; or silbador &#8212; puts a finger in his or her mouth to increase the whistle&#8217;s pitch, while the other hand can be cupped to adjust the direction of the sound. &#8216;There is much more ambiguity in the whistled signal than in the spoken signal,&#8217; explains lead researcher Manuel Carreiras, psychology professor at the University of La Laguna on the Canary island of Tenerife. Because whistled &#8216;words&#8217; can be hard to distinguish, silbadores rely on repetition, as well as awareness of context, to make themselves understood.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>The silbadores of Gomera are traditionally shepherds and other isolated mountain folk, and their novel means of staying in touch allows them to communicate over distances of up to 10 kilometres. Carreiras explains that silbadores are able to pass a surprising amount of information via their whistles. &#8216;In daily life they use &#8216;whistles to communicate short commands, but any Spanish sentence could be whistled.&#8217; Silbo has proved particularly useful when fires have occurred on the island and rapid communication across large areas has been vital.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>The study team used neuroimaging equipment to contrast the brain activity of silbadores while listening to whistled and spoken Spanish. Results showed the left temporal lobe of the brain, which is usually associated with spoken language, was engaged during the processing of Silbo. The researchers found that other key regions in the brain&#8217;s frontal lobe also responded to the whistles, including those activated in response to sign language among deaf people. When the experiments were repeated with non-whistlers, however, activation was observed in all areas of the brain.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>&#8216;Our results provide more evidence about the flexibility of human capacity for language in a variety of forms,&#8217; Corina says. &#8216;These data suggest that left-hemisphere language regions are uniquely adapted for communicative purposes, independent of the modality of signal. The non- Silbo speakers were not recognising Silbo as a language. They had nothing to grab onto, so multiple areas of their brains were activated.&#8217;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Carreiras says the origins of Silbo Gomero remain obscure, but that indigenous Canary Islanders, who were of North African origin, already had a whistled language when Spain conquered the volcanic islands in the 15th century. Whistled languages survive today in Papua New Guinea, Mexico, Vietnam, Guyana, China, Nepal, Senegal, and a few mountainous pockets in southern Europe. There are thought to be as many as 70 whistled languages still in use, though only 12 have been described and studied scientifically. This form of communication is an adaptation found among cultures where people are often isolated from each other, according to Julien Meyer, a researcher at the Institute of Human Sciences in Lyon, France. &#8216;They are mostly used in mountains or dense forests,&#8217; he says. &#8216;Whistled languages are quite clearly defined and represent an original adaptation of the spoken language for the needs of isolated human groups.&#8217;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>But with modern communication technology now widely available, researchers say whistled languages like Silbo are threatened with extinction. With dwindling numbers of Gomera islanders still fluent in the language, Canaries&#8217; authorities are taking steps to try to ensure its survival. Since 1999, Silbo Gomero has been taught in all of the island&#8217;s elementary schools. In addition, locals are seeking assistance from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). &#8216;The local authorities are trying to get an award from the organisation to declare [Silbo Gomero] as something that should be preserved for humanity,&#8217; Carreiras adds.</span><font size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div>",

          "content": "<div><span><b>Environmental practices of big businesses</b></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span>The environmental practices of big businesses are shaped by a fundamental fact that for many of us offends our sense of justice. Depending on the circumstances, a business may maximize the amount of money it makes, at least in the short term, by damaging the environment and hurting people. That is still the case today for fishermen in an unmanaged fishery without quotas, and for international logging companies with short-term leases on tropical rainforest land in places with corrupt officials and unsophisticated landowners. When government regulation is effective, and when the public is environmentally aware, environmentally clean big businesses may out-compete dirty ones, but the reverse is likely to be true if government regulation is ineffective and if the public doesn&#8217;t care.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>It is easy for the rest of us to blame a business for helping itself by hurting other people. But blaming alone is unlikely to produce change. It ignores the fact that businesses are not charities but profit-making companies, and that publicly owned companies with shareholders are under obligation to those shareholders to maximize profits, provided that they do so by legal means. US laws make a company&#8217;s directors legally liable for something termed &#8216;breach of fiduciary responsibility&#8217; if they knowingly manage a company in a way that reduces profits. The car manufacturer Henry Ford was in fact successfully sued by shareholders in 1919 for raising the minimum wage of his workers to 5$&#160; per day: the courts declared that, while Ford&#8217;s humanitarian sentiments about his employees were nice, his business existed to make profits for its stockholders.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Our blaming of businesses also ignores the ultimate responsibility of the public for creating the conditions that let a business profit through destructive environmental policies. In the long run, it is the public, either directly or through its politicians, that has the power to make such destructive policies unprofitable and illegal, and to make sustainable environmental policies profitable.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>The public can do that by suing businesses for harming them, as happened after the Exxon Valdez disaster, in which over 40,000 m3 of oil were spilled off the coast of Alaska. The public may also make their opinion felt by preferring to buy sustainably harvested products; by making employees of companies with poor track records feel ashamed of their company and complain to their own management; by preferring their governments to award valuable contracts to businesses with a good environmental track record; and by pressing their governments to pass and enforce laws and regulations requiring good environmental practices.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In turn, big businesses can exert powerful pressure on any suppliers that might ignore public or government pressure. For instance, after the US public became concerned about the spread of a disease known as BSE, which was transmitted to humans through infected meat, the US government&#8217;s Food and Drug Administration introduced rules demanding that the meat industry abandon practices associated with the risk of the disease spreading. But for five years the meat packers refused to follow these, claiming that they would be too expensive to obey. However, when a major fast-food company then made the same demands after customer purchases of its hamburgers plummeted, the meat industry complied within weeks. The public&#8217;s task is therefore to identify which links in the supply chain are sensitive to public pressure: for instance, fast-food chains or jewelry stores, but not meat packers or gold miners.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Some readers may be disappointed or outraged that I place the ultimate reSponsibility for business practices harming the public on the public itself. I also believe that the public must accept the necessity for higher prices for products to cover the added costs, if any, of sound environmental practices. My views may seem to ignore the belief that businesses should act in accordance with moral principles even if this leads to a reduction in their profits. But I think we have to recognize that, throughout human history, in all politically complex human societies, government regulation has arisen precisely because it was found that not only did moral principles need to be made explicit, they also needed to be enforced.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><div>To me, the conclusion that the public has the ultimate responsibility for the behavior of even the biggest businesses is empowering and hopeful, rather than disappointing. My conclusion is not a moralistic one about who is right or wrong, admirable or selfish, a good guy or a bad guy. In the past, businesses have changed when the public came to expect and require different behavior, to reward businesses for behavior that the public wanted, and to make things difficult for businesses practicing behaviors that the public didn&#8217;t want. I predict that in the future, just as in the past, changes in public attitudes will be essential for changes in businesses&#8217; environmental practices.</div><font><font size=\"2\"><div><br></div></font></font></span></div>",

          "content": "<span><b>The Wolf in Europe</b></span><div><b><br></b></div><div><b><br></b><div><span>Wolves once existed throughout much of Europe. However, conflicts with humans and fears originating from religious beliefs, myths and folklore influenced human attitudes towards wolves and, as a result, they have been persecuted for hundreds of years. The wolf has created the most controversy of any predator in Europe, as it occupies conflicting places in people&#8217;s imaginations, being simultaneously loved and hated. On one hand, it is held up as a symbol of wilderness, while for others, wolves symbolise waste and wanton destruction. As a result, wolf conservation is almost always a difficult matter.</span><br></div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Originally, the wolf was one of the world&#8217;s most widely distributed large mammals. It has become extinct in much of Western Europe, in Mexico and much of the USA, and their present distribution is more restricted; wolves occur primarily but not exclusively in remote areas. Their original worldwide range has been reduced by about one-third by deliberate persecution due to attacks on livestock and fear of attacks on humans. Since about 1970, legal protection, land-use changes and rural human population shifts to cities have arrested wolf population declines and fostered natural recolonisation in parts of its range and reintroduction. Continued threats include competition with humans for livestock and game species, exaggerated concern by the public regarding the threat and danger of wolves, and fragmentation of habitat, with resulting areas becoming too small for populations with enduring viability.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Historically, wolves have been heavily persecuted in Europe for millennia, and were exterminated from most of northern and western Europe in the last two centuries, probably reaching their minimum in the 1940&#8217;s to 1960&#8217;s. Since then, many populations have begun to recover and expand their range, for example in Spain and Italy. Furthermore, in the last twenty years, the species has been recovering naturally and reappearing in areas from which they had become extinct, for example in France, northern Italy, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany and Switzerland. This recovery has revealed their remarkable ecological adaptability, enabling them to survive in extremely diverse environments. Wolves can basically survive anywhere they can find a source of food, and this can be of various forms, from wild animals, to livestock, to garbage. The only limiting factor seems to be human persecution. As a result, the conservation of wolves is less of an ecological issue and more a social issue, strictly linked to the diverse cultural and socio-economic conditions of the areas they inhabit. This makes international legislation extremely hard to enforce in highly diverse European countries. This is a particularly sensitive issue when it comes to the conservation and management of wolf populations that are transboundary in nature, occupying territories belonging to different countries, and thus requiring international collaboration. In addition, the present distribution of wolves around Europe is extremely uneven and densities vary greatly from country to country. The situation is made even more difficult by the lack of population data across different countries.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Human acceptance of wolves is a major problem in many areas, especially in areas where wolves have returned after an absence and it is important to not underestimate these conflicts, or to believe that they are only linked to livestock. Understanding the reasons why acceptance varies so much between countries could be important for finding solutions. As a result of humans&#8217; attitude to wolves, human- caused mortality, either through hunter harvest, official lethal control, or poaching, is the main limiting factor for wolf populations. There are several countries where wolf management is clearly unsustainable due to over-harvest and even state sanctioned bounty programs within Europe. On the other hand, properly regulated wolf harvest and control appears to be compatible with wolf conservation in many countries. In many cases, it may be a prerequisite for public acceptance by allowing countries to keep wolf populations at a level that is socially acceptable. Countries within Europe have used many different legal mechanisms to maintain management flexibility with respect to being able to kill wolves, using exceptions, derogations or various interpretations of convention definitions.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Poaching is a widespread problem in many countries with very diverse socio-economic backgrounds and it occurs because of the aforementioned fears, but also for pure sport. There is a clear need for effective education and law enforcement throughout wolf range. The sometimes chronic lack of control over poaching greatly reduces management flexibility through legal means, because of the need to account for this uncertainty.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Another issue facing wolves in Europe is a lack of natural prey. Population sizes of the wolf&#8217;s usual prey, such as large grazing mammals (i.e. deer, wild boar and wild goat) have undergone a remarkable reduction over the last decades due to overhunting, habitat loss (usually deforestation) and fragmentation, and grazing competition between domestic and wild herbivores. It has been proved that there is a strong correlation between prey and carnivore abundance &#8211; approximately 10 000 kilograms of prey supports about 90 kilograms of large carnivore biomass, regardless of species. When sufficient prey is unavailable, large carnivore populations will decline, possibly becoming locally extinct. In the case of the wolf in Europe, this problem can be compounded by wolf conflicts with livestock, which increase as the wolves search for alternative food sources. Similarly, when wolves are forced to range more widely in search of prey, they may face greater exposure to human-related threats, including mortality on roads and direct persecution in regions with high human population densities.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div>",

Nevertheless, 1.1 to 1.8</span></div><div><span>billion people globally lack access to safe water. It has been predicted that two-thirds of the world&#8217;s</span></div><div><span>inhabitants could live in water-stressed conditions by 2025, and this will be exacerbated by the</span></div><div><span>demands of the increasing numbers of people needing water, increasing numbers of bigger towns,</span></div><div><span>and climate change.</span></div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Without improved sanitation and sustainable supplies of water of sufficient quantity and quality, many countries will suffer from increased poverty and disease, food and energy insecurity and economic dislocations. These problems have the potential to undermine economic development, exacerbate migration pressures, increase civil unrest, reduce trade and export opportunities, and prevent countries from advancing policies and programs. Safe water is fundamental to solving challenges to human health, economic development, and peace and security. Water problems are unfortunately difficult to solve and the needy and weak, in particular women and girls, can be the most difficult to improve the lot of in many societies.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Drinking water supplies are safest in the developed world. However, even the safest drinking water sources can suffer adulteration, causing sickness and disease from waterborne germs and require appropriate treatment to remove disease-causing agents. Public drinking water systems use various methods of treatment to provide safe drinking water for their communities. Today, the most common steps in water treatment used by community water systems are uniform in most developed countries.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Coagulation and flocculation are the first two steps in water treatment. Positively-charged chemicals are added to the water and these neutralise the negative charge of dirt and other dissolved particles in the water. When this occurs, the particles bind with the chemicals and form larger particles, called floc. During the next step, floc settles to the bottom of the water supply, due to its weight. This process involves the settling of other solids and is called sedimentation. Once the solids have settled to the bottom, the clear water on top will go through to the next stage to go through filters of varying pore sixes and different compositions, such as sand, gravel, and charcoal, and pore sizes, in order to remove dissolved particles, such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and chemicals. After the water has been filtered, disinfection is performed to kill any remaining parasites, bacteria, and viruses. The water is then stored until it is piped to homes and businesses.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Water may be treated differently in different communities depending on the quality of the water entering the treatment plant. Typically, surface water requires more treatment and filtration than ground water, because lakes, rivers, and streams hold more earth and pollutants and are more likely to be contaminated.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Even though most countries set standards for public drinking water, many people use a home water treatment. Household water treatment systems are composed of two categories: point-of-use and point-of-entry. Point-of-entry systems are typically installed after the water meter and treat most of the water entering a residence. Point-of-use systems are systems that treat water in batches and deliver water to a tap, such as a kitchen or bathroom sink or an auxiliary faucet mounted next to a tap. The most common types of household water treatment systems might consist of four components. The first is a filtration system, which is a device that removes impurities from water by means of a physical barrier, chemical, and/or biological process. The second is a water softener, which is a device that reduces the hardness of the water. A water softener typically uses sodium or potassium ions to replace calcium and magnesium ions. The third is a distillation system, which executes a process in which impure water is boiled and the steam is collected and condensed in a separate container, leaving many of the solid contaminants behind. The fourth is disinfection, which is a physical or chemical process in which pathogenic microorganisms are deactivated or killed. Examples of chemical disinfectants are chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and ozone. Examples of physical disinfectants include ultraviolet light, electronic radiation, and heat.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Another treatment that public water is subjected to is fluoridation. For example, people in the United States have benefited for 70 years from drinking water with fluoride, leading to better dental health. Drinking fluoridated water keeps teeth strong and reduces tooth decay by about 25 per cent in children and adults. By preventing cavities, community water fluoridation has been shown to save money for families and for the US health care system. Oral health in the United States is much better today than it was many years ago; however, cavities are still one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood. Community water fluoridation is the most cost-effective way to deliver fluoride to people of all ages, education levels, and income levels who live in a community. Most water has some fluoride, but usually not enough to prevent cavities, but community water systems can add the right amount of fluoride to the local drinking water to prevent them. This has led to community water fluoridation being regarded as one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th Century. Some bottled waters do not have fluoride put in as an ingredient, and some do. Fluoride can occur naturally in source waters used for bottling or be added, but most bottled waters contain fluoride at levels that are less than optimal for good oral health.</span><br></div>",

Beauty pageants have also long been part of American popular culture. The Miss America Pageant is the most well-known and it was started in 1921 as a &#8216;bathing beauty&#8217; contest to entice summer holidaymakers to stay in town past Labor Day. Local newsman Herb Test created history by offering to title the girl who won &#8216;Miss America.&#8217; Out of the eight competitors for the title, Margaret Gorman, who represented the nation&#8217;s capital as Miss Washington D.C., was declared the beauty queen, winning the first-ever Miss America title. For several years afterward, the contest was dogged by controversies. First, the contest came under criticism of corruption and bias. Then, 15-year-old Marian Bergeron won the crown. When her age was discovered, she was disqualified, but the crown had already been stolen from her hotel.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Paragraph B&#160;</b></span></div><div><span>In 1935, the pageant was revived by producer Lenora Slaughter. By this time, the nation was in the grip of Hollywood fever. Pageant-winners were often offered Hollywood screen tests, and film producers from Hollywood started scouring these contests for potential stars of the silver screen. Some women actually did make it to the screen that way, including Dorothy Lamour, who went on to co-star in several successful movies. It was only in 1938 that a skills component became mandatory for the pageant. Slaughter also decided to offer a college scholarship to the winner, the then significant sum of $5,000. In 1948, history was made again when Slaughter announced that henceforth the winners would be crowned in evening gowns only.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Paragraph C&#160;</b></span></div><div><span>As times changed, though, so have beauty pageants. Today, this annual U.S. national competition, as well as state and local pageants, claim to showcase the talent, intellect, and beauty of modern women. The pageants provide popular entertainment for those at the competitions and, through the broadcast media, to those watching at home. Funds for sponsoring the pageants and providing the prizes are traditionally drawn from individuals, small businesses, corporations, civic groups, foundations, and universities. Commercial sponsors reap favourable promotion opportunities, leading to increased product visibility and market share. Prizes include the coveted crown, and may also include trophies, vacations, clothes, jewelry, savings bonds, and cash. Besides prizes, the winner has the opportunity to pursue her career and community service goals, as well as the obligation to represent the pageant sponsors&#8217; commercial interests.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Paragraph D&#160;</b></span></div><div><span>Beauty contests have various advantages for the contestants. Firstly, in order to compete and be successful in the beauty pageant world, contestants have to have a pretty significant amount of self- discipline. They have to train so that they are perfect on stage, keep a strict diet and workout regime in place, and put in the work to make themselves look their best. This quality is a skill that can help participants in many different aspects of life, especially if they begin competing at a young age. Secondly, contestants have to be well-rounded people in order to succeed in the pageant world. It isn&#8217;t all about looking pretty and wearing fancy clothes. They also have to be prepared to answer insightful questions and be able to handle themselves under pressure. These are skills that are needed to be successful, not only in the pageant world, but in real life as well. Thirdly, although some beauty pageants are just about winning the contest, others have some real advantages to participating. Many pageants offer cash rewards for the winner, and pageants for younger girls often give out college scholarships. This is an advantage, because it helps these young people to begin to prepare for their future, and gets them in the mindset of self-improvement. Finally, the pageant world is an interconnected community of parents, participants, and trainers. When people compete in many pageants, they begin to develop bonds with the people that they are competing with on a regular basis. These are friendships that will likely last for a long time.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Paragraph E&#160;</b></span></div><div><span>The disadvantages of beauty contests are wide-ranging. Firstly, beauty pageants are for the beautiful. This is harmful to young girls and even adults who feel they cannot compete. The strong focus on physical appearance can cause competing girls to form obsessions, and a loss gives the feeling that they were not pretty enough to win. In addition, beauty pageants also tacitly approve of the ideology for both men and women that women should only be evaluated by their personal appearance. Secondly, the winners of the big name pageants of the past all have one thing in common: they are thin. This simple fact creates a norm for girls who compete in pageants to live up to. The result is a group of competing young girls within which eating disorders and depression run rampant. Eating disorders are extremely unhealthy, and can cause irreversible damage to girls&#8217; bodies. The resulting depression can naturally lead to severe problems as well. Finally, exploitation is a common word heard with regards to beauty pageants. In child pageants, which are rapidly growing in popularity around the world, the children are taken advantage of because they often have no say as to whether or not they compete.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><div><span><b>Paragraph F&#160;</b></span></div><div><span>Pageant organisers would counter the above arguments by maintaining that the contests offer substantial benefits to the contestants and sponsors and provide a forum to showcase community customs and traditions. The organisers claim that pageants can therefore promote the growth and development of the community, which substantially benefits the said community as a whole. Pageants also offer a recreational outlet for participants and community members.</span><br></div></div>",

Concrete is the second most used substance in the global economy, after water &#8211; and one of the world&#8217;s biggest single sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The chemical process by which cement, the key ingredient of concrete, is created results in large quantities of carbon dioxide. The UN estimates that there will be 9.8 billion people living on the planet by mid-century. They will need somewhere to live. If concrete is the only answer to the construction of new cities, then carbon emissions will soar, aggravating global warming. And so scientists have started innovating with other materials, in a scramble for alternatives to a universal commodity that has underpinned our modem life for many years.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>B</b>. The problem with replacing concrete is that it is so very good at what it does. Chris Cheeseman, an engineering professor at Imperial College London, says the key thing to consider is the extent to which concrete is used around the world, and is likely to continue to be used. &#8216;Concrete is not a high-carbon product. Cement is high carbon, but concrete is not. But it is the scale on which it is used that makes it high carbon. The sheer scale of manufacture is so huge, that is the issue.&#8217;</span></div><div><br><span><b>C</b>. Not only are the ingredients of concrete relatively cheap and found in abundance in most places around the globe, the stuff itself has marvellous properties: Portland cement, the vital component of concrete, is mouldable and pourable, but quickly sets hard. Cheeseman also notes another advantage: concrete and steel have similar thermal expansion properties, so steel can be used to reinforce concrete, making it far stronger and more flexible as a building material than it could be on its own. According to Cheeseman, all these factors together make concrete hard to beat. &#8216;Concrete is amazing stuff. Making anything with similar properties is going to be very difficult.&#8217;</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>D</b>. A possible alternative to concrete is wood. Making buildings from wood may seem like a rather medieval idea, but climate change is driving architects to turn to treated timber as a possible resource. Recent years have seen the emergence of tall buildings constructed almost entirely from timber. Vancouver, Vienna and Brumunddal in Norway are all home to constructed tall, wooden buildings.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>E</b>. Using wood to construct buildings, however, is not straightforward. Wood expands as it absorbs moisture from the air and is susceptible to pests, not to mention fire. But treating wood and combining it with other materials can improve its properties. Cross-laminated timber is engineered wood. An adhesive is used to stick layers of solid-sawn timber together, crosswise, to form building blocks. This material is light but has the strength of concrete and steel. Construction experts say that wooden buildings can be constructed at a greater speed than ones of concrete and steel and the process, it seems, is quieter.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>F</b>. Stora Enso is Europe&#8217;s biggest supplier of cross-laminated timber, and its vice-president Markus Mannstrom reports that the company is seeing increasing demand globally for building in wood, with climate change concerns the key driver. Finland, with its large forests, where Stora Enso is based, has been leading the way, but the company is seeing a rise in demand for its timber products across the world, including in Asia. Of course, using timber in a building also locks away the carbon that it absorbed as it grew. But even treated wood has its limitations and only when a wider range of construction projects has been proven in practice will it be possible to see wood as a real alternative to concrete in constructing tall buildings.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>G</b>. Fly ash and slag from iron ore are possible alternatives to cement in a concrete mix. Fly ash, a byproduct of coal-burning power plants, can be incorporated into concrete mixes to make up as much as 15 to 30% of the cement, without harming the strength or durability of the resulting mix. Iron-ore slag, a byproduct of the iron-ore smelting process, can be used in a similar way. Their incorporation into concrete mixes has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</span></div><div><span><br></span><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>But Anna Surgenor, of the UK&#8217;s Green Building Council, notes that although these waste products can save carbon in the concrete mix, their use is not always straightforward. &#8216;It&#8217;s possible to replace the cement content in concrete with waste products to lower the overall carbon impact. But there are several calculations that need to be considered across the entire life cycle of the building- these include factoring in where these materials are being shipped from. If they are transported over long distances, using fossil fuels, the use of alternative materials might not make sense from an overall carbon reduction perspective.&#8217;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b><br></b></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span><b>H.</b> </span><span>While these technologies are all promising ideas, they are either unproven or based on materials that are not abundant. In their overview of innovation in the concrete industry, Felix Preston and Johanna Lehne of the UK&#8217;s Royal Institute of International Affairs reached the conclusion that, &#8216;Some novel cements have been discussed for more than a decade within the research community, without breaking through. At present, these alternatives are rarely as cost-effective as conventional cement, and they face raw-material shortages and resistance from customers.&#8217;</span></p></div></span>",

Steam had already enjoyed a long and successful career in the railways, so it was only natural that the technology evolved into a miniaturized version which was separate from the trains. But these early cars inherited steam&#8217;s weaknesses along with its strengths. The boilers had to be lit by hand, and they required about twenty minutes to build up pressure before they could be driven. Furthermore, their water reservoirs only lasted for about thirty miles before needing replenishment. Despite such shortcomings, these newly designed self-propelled carriages offered quick transportation, and by the early 1900s it was not uncommon to see such machines shuttling wealthy citizens around town.</div><div><br></div><div><b>B.</b> But the glory days of steam cars were few. A new technology called the Internal Combustion Engine soon appeared, which offered the ability to drive down the road just moments after starting up. At first, these noisy gasoline cars were unpopular because they were more complicated to operate and they had difficult hand-crank starters, which were known to break arms when the engines backfired. But in 1912 General Motors introduced the electric starter, and over the following few years steam power was gradually phased out.</div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b>. Even as the market was declining, four brothers made one last effort to rekindle the technology. Between 1906 and 1909, while still attending high school, Abner Doble and his three brothers built their first steam car in their parents&#8217; basement. It comprised parts taken from a wrecked early steam car but reconfigured to drive an engine of their own design. Though it did not run well, the Doble brothers went on to build a second and third prototype in the following years. Though the Doble boys&#8217; third prototype, nicknamed the Model B, still lacked the convenience of an internal combustion engine, it drew the attention of automobile trade magazines due to its numerous improvements over previous steam cars. The Model B proved to be superior to gasoline automobiles in many ways. Its high-pressure steam drove the engine pistons in virtual silence, in contrast to clattering gas engines which emitted the aroma of burned hydrocarbons. Perhaps most impressively, the Model B was amazingly swift. It could accelerate from zero to sixty miles per hour in just fifteen seconds, a feat described as &#8216;remarkable acceleration&#8217; by Automobile magazine in 1914.</div><div><br></div><div><b>D.</b> The following year Abner Doble drove the Model B from Massachusetts to Detroit in order to seek investment in his automobile design, which he used to open the General Engineering Company. He and his brothers immediately began working on the Model C, which was intended to expand upon the innovations of the Model B. The brothers added features such as a key-based ignition in the cabin, eliminating the need for the operator to manually ignite the boiler. With these enhancements, the Dobles&#8217; new car company promised a steam vehicle which would provide all of the convenience of a gasoline car, but with much greater speed, much simpler driving controls, and a virtually silent powerplant. By the following April, the General Engineering Company had received 5,390 deposits for Doble Detroits, which were scheduled for delivery in early 1918.</div><div><br></div><div><b>E.</b> Later that year Abner Doble delivered unhappy news to those eagerly awaiting the delivery of their modern new cars. Those buyers who received the handful of completed cars complained that the vehicles were sluggish and erratic, sometimes going in reverse when they should go forward. The new engine design, though innovative, was still plagued with serious glitches.</div><div><br></div><div><b>F. </b>The brothers made one final attempt to produce a viable steam automobile. In early 1924, the Doble brothers shipped a Model E to New York City to be road-tested by the Automobile Club of America. After sitting overnight in freezing temperatures, the car was pushed out into the road and left to sit for over an hour in the frosty morning air. At the turn of the key, the boiler lit and reached its operating pressure inside of forty seconds. As they drove the test vehicle further, they found that its evenly distributed weight lent it surprisingly good handling, even though it was so heavy. As the new Doble steamer was further developed and tested, its maximum speed was pushed to over a hundred miles per hour, and it achieved about fifteen miles per gallon of kerosene with negligible emissions.</div><div><br></div><div><b>G.</b> Sadly, the Dobles&#8217; brilliant steam car never was a financial success. Priced at around $18,000 in 1924, it was popular only among the very wealthy. Plus, it is said that no two Model Es were quite the same, because Abner Doble tinkered endlessly with the design. By the time the company folded in 1931, fewer than fifty of the amazing Model E steam cars had been produced. For his whole career, until his death in 1961, Abner Doble remained adamant that steam-powered automobiles were at least equal to gasoline cars, if not superior. Given the evidence, he may have been right. Many of the Model E Dobles which have survived are still in good working condition, some having been driven over half a million miles with only normal maintenance. Astonishingly, an unmodified Doble Model E runs clean enough to pass the emissions laws in California today, and they are pretty strict. It is true that the technology poses some difficult problems, but you cannot help but wonder how efficient a steam car might be with the benefit of modern materials and computers.

It&#8217;s an English literature lesson in a UK school, and the teacher has just read an extract from Shakespeare&#8217;s Romeo and Juliet with a class of 15-year-olds. He&#8217;s given some of the students copies of No Fear Shakespeare, a kid-friendly translation of the original. For three students, even these literacy demands are beyond them. Another girl simply can&#8217;t focus and he gives her pens and paper to draw with. The teacher can ask the No Fear group to identify the key characters and maybe provide a tentative plot summary. He can ask most of the class about character development, and five of them might be able to support their statements with textual evidence. Now two curious students are wondering whether Shakespeare advocates living a life of moderation or one of passionate engagement.</div><div><br></div><div>As a teacher myself, I&#8217;d think my lesson would be going rather well if the discussion went as described above. But wouldn&#8217;t this kind of class work better if there weren&#8217;t such a huge gap between the top and the bottom? If we put all the kids who needed literacy support into one class, and all the students who want to discuss the virtue of moderation into another?</div><div><br></div><div>The practice of &#8216;streaming&#8217;, or &#8216;tracking&#8217;, involves separating students into classes depending on their diagnosed levels of attainment. At a macro level, it requires the establishment of academically selective schools for the brightest students, and comprehensive schools for the rest. Within schools, it means selecting students into a &#8216;stream&#8217; of general ability, or &#8216;sets&#8217; of subject-specific ability. The practice is intuitively appealing to almost every stakeholder.</div><div><br></div><div>I have heard the mixed-ability model attacked by way of analogy: a group hike. The fittest in the group take the lead and set a brisk pace, only to have to stop and wait every 20 minutes. This is frustrating, and their enthusiasm wanes. Meanwhile, the slowest ones are not only embarrassed but physically struggling to keep up. What&#8217;s worse, they never get a long enough break. They honestly just want to quit. Hiking, they feel, is not for them.</div><div><br></div><div>Mixed-ability classes bore students, frustrate parents and bum out teachers. The brightest ones will never summit Mount Qomolangma, and the stragglers won&#8217;t enjoy the lovely stroll in the park they are perhaps more suited to. Individuals suffer at the demands of the collective, mediocrity prevails. So: is learning like hiking?</div><div><br></div><div>The current pedagogical paradigm is arguably that of constructivism, which emerged out of the work of psychologist Lev Vygotsky. In the 1930s, Vygotsky emphasised the importance of targeting a student&#8217;s specific &#8216;zone of proximal development&#8217; (ZPD). This is the gap between what they can achieve only with support &#8211; teachers, textbooks, worked examples, parents and so on &#8211; and what they can achieve independently. The purpose of teaching is to provide and then gradually remove this &#8216;scaffolding&#8217; until they are autonomous. If we accept this model, it follows that streaming students with similar ZPDs would be an efficient and effective solution. And that forcing everyone on the same hike &#8211; regardless of aptitude &#8211; would be madness.</div><div><br></div><div>Despite all this, there is limited empirical evidence to suggest that streaming results in better outcomes for students. Professor John Hattie, director of the Melbourne Education Research Institute, notes that &#8216;tracking has minimal effects on learning outcomes&#8217;. What is more, streaming appears to significantly &#8211; and negatively &#8211; affect those students assigned to the lowest sets. These students tend to have much higher representation of low socio economic class. Less significant is the small benefit for those lucky clever students in the higher sets. The overall result is that the smart stay smart and the dumb get dumber, further entrenching the social divide.</div><div><br></div><div>In the latest update of Hattie&#8217;s influential meta-analysis of factors influencing student achievement, one of the most significant factors is the teachers&#8217; estimate of achievement. Streaming students by diagnosed achievement automatically limits what the teacher feels the student is capable of. Meanwhile, in a mixed environment, teachers&#8217; estimates need to be more diverse and flexible.</div><div><br></div><div>While streaming might seem to help teachers effectively target a student&#8217;s ZPD, it can underestimate the importance of peer-to-peer learning. A crucial aspect of constructivist theory is the role of the MKO &#8211; &#8216;more knowledgeable other&#8217; &#8211; in knowledge construction. While teachers are traditionally the MKOs in classrooms, the value of knowledgeable student peers must not go unrecognised either.</div><div><br></div><div>I find it amazing to watch students get over an idea to their peers in ways that I would never think of. They operate with different language tools and different social tools from teachers and, having just learnt it themselves, they possess similar cognitive structures to their struggling classmates. There is also something exciting about passing on skills and knowledge that you yourself have just mastered &#8211; a certain pride and zeal, a certain freshness to the interaction between &#8216;teacher&#8217; and &#8216;learner&#8217; that is often lost by the expert for whom the steps are obvious and the joy of discovery forgotten.</div><div><br></div><div>Having a variety of different abilities in a collaborative learning environment provides valuable resources for helping students meet their learning needs, not to mention improving their communication and social skills. And today, more than ever, we need the many to flourish &#8211; not suffer at the expense of a few bright stars. Once a year, I go on a hike with my class, a mixed bunch of students. It is challenging. The fittest students realise they need to encourage the reluctant. There are lookouts who report back, and extra items to carry for others. We make it &#8211; together.</div><div><br></div>",

More and more private companies and city authorities are investing in green roofs, drawn to their wide-ranging benefits. Among the benefits are saving on energy costs, mitigating the risk of floods, making habitats for urban wildlife, tackling air pollution and even growing food. These increasingly radical urban designs can help cities adapt to the monumental problems they face, such as access to resources and a lack of green space due to development. But the involvement of city authorities, businesses and other institutions is crucial to ensuring their success &#8211; as is research investigating different options to suit the variety of rooftop spaces found in cities. The UK is relatively new to developing green roofs, and local governments and institutions are playing a major role in spreading the practice. London is home to much of the UK&#8217;s green roof market, mainly due to forward-thinking policies such as the London Plan, which has paved the way to more than doubling the area of green roofs in the capital.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>B.</b>&#160;</span></span><span>Ongoing research is showcasing how green roofs in cities can integrate with &#8216;living walls&#8217;: environmentally friendly walls which are partially or completely covered with greenery, including a growing medium, such as soil or water. Research also indicates that green roofs can be integrated with drainage systems on the ground, such as street trees, so that the water is managed better and the built environment is made more sustainable. There is also evidence to demonstrate the social value of green roofs. Doctors are increasingly prescribing time spent gardening outdoors for patients dealing with anxiety and depression. And research has found that access to even the most basic green spaces can provide a better quality of life for dementia sufferers and help people avoid obesity.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>C.</b>&#160;</span><span>In North America, green roofs have become mainstream, with a wide array of expansive, accessible and food-producing roofs installed in buildings. Again, city leaders and authorities have helped push the movement forward &#8211; only recently, San Francisco, USA, created a policy requiring new buildings to have green roofs. Toronto, Canada, has policies dating from the 1990s, encouraging the development of urban farms on rooftops. These countries also benefit from having newer buildings than in many parts of the world, which makes it easier to install green roofs. Being able to keep enough water at roof height and distribute it right across the rooftop is crucial to maintaining the plants on any green roof &#8211; especially on &#8216;edible roofs&#8217; where fruit and vegetables are farmed. And it&#8217;s much easier to do this in newer buildings, which can typically hold greater weight, than to retro-fit old ones. Having a stronger roof also makes it easier to grow a greater variety of plants, since the soil can be deeper.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>D.</b>&#160;</span><span>For green roofs to become the norm for new developments, there needs to be support from public authorities and private investors. Those responsible for maintaining buildings may have to acquire new skills, such as landscaping, and in some cases, volunteers may be needed to help out. Other considerations include installing drainage paths, meeting health and safety requirements and perhaps allowing access for the public, as well as planning restrictions and disruption from regular activities in and around the buildings during installation. To convince investors and developers that installing green roofs is worthwhile, economic arguments are still the most important. The term &#8216;natural capital&#8217; has been developed to explain the economic value of nature; for example, measuring the money saved by installing natural solutions to protect against flood damage, adapt to climate change or help people lead healthier and happier lives.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>E.&#160;</b></span><span>As the expertise about green roofs grows, official standards have been developed to ensure that they are designed, constructed and maintained properly, and function well. Improvements in the science and technology underpinning green roof development have also led to new variations in the concept. For example, &#8216;blue roofs&#8217; enable buildings to hold water over longer periods of time, rather than draining it away quickly &#8211; crucial in times of heavier rainfall. There are also combinations of green roofs with solar panels, and &#8216;brown roofs&#8217; which are wilder in nature and maximise biodiversity. If the trend continues, it could create new jobs and a more vibrant and sustainable local food economy &#8211; alongside many other benefits. There are still barriers to overcome, but the evidence so far indicates that green roofs have the potential to transform cities and help them function sustainably long into the future. The success stories need to be studied and replicated elsewhere, to make green, blue, brown and food-producing roofs the norm in cities around the world.</span></div>",

          "content": "<div><b>The growth mindset</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><span><span>Over the past century, a powerful idea has taken root in the educational landscape. The concept of intelligence as something innate has been supplanted by the idea that intelligence is not fixed, and that, with the right training, we can be the authors of our own cognitive capabilities. Psychologist Alfred Binet, the developer of the first intelligence tests, was one of many 19th-century scientists who held that earlier view and sought to quantify cognitive ability. Then, in the early 20th century, progressive thinkers revolted against the notion that inherent ability is destiny. Instead, educators such as John Dewey argued that every child&#8217;s intelligence could be developed, given the right environment.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>&#8216;Growth mindset theory&#8217; is a relatively new &#8211; and extremely popular &#8211; version of this idea. In many schools today you will see hallways covered in motivational posters and hear speeches on the mindset of great sporting heroes who simply believed their way to the top. A major focus of the growth mindset in schools is coaxing students away from seeing failure as an indication of their ability, and towards seeing it as a chance to improve that ability. As educationalist Jeff Howard noted several decades ago: &#8216;Smart is not something that you just are, smart is something that you can get.&#8217;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>The idea of the growth mindset is based on the work of psychologist Carol Dweck in California in the 1990s. In one key experiment, Dweck divided a group of 10- to 12-year-olds into two groups. All were told that they had achieved a high score on a test but the first group were praised for their intelligence in achieving this, while the others were praised for their effort. The second group &#8211; those who had been instilled with a &#8216;growth mindset&#8217; &#8211; were subsequently far more likely to put effort into future tasks. Meanwhile, the former took on only those tasks that would not risk their sense of worth. This group had inferred that success or failure is due to innate ability, and this &#8216;fixed mindset&#8217; had led them to fear of failure and lack of effort. Praising ability actually made the students perform worse, while praising effort emphasised that change was possible.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>One of the greatest impediments to successfully implementing a growth mindset, however, is the education system itself: in many parts of the world, the school climate is obsessed with performance in the form of constant testing, analysing and ranking of students &#8211; a key characteristic of the fixed mindset. Nor is it unusual for schools to create a certain cognitive dissonance, when they applaud the benefits of a growth mindset but then hand out fixed target grades in lessons based on performance.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Aside from the implementation problem, the original growth mindset research has also received harsh criticism. The statistician Andrew Gelman claims that &#8216;their research designs have enough degrees of freedom that they could take their data to support just about any theory at all&#8217;. Professor of Psychology Timothy Bates, who has been trying to replicate Dweck&#8217;s work, is finding that the results are repeatedly null. He notes that: &#8216;People with a growth mindset don&#8217;t cope any better with failure &#8230; Kids with the growth mindset aren&#8217;t getting better grades, either before or after our intervention study.&#8217;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Much of this criticism is not lost on Dweck, and she deserves great credit for responding to it and adapting her work accordingly. In fact, she argues that her work has been misunderstood and misapplied in a range of ways. She has also expressed concerns that her theories are being misappropriated in schools by being conflated with the self-esteem movement: &#8216;For me the growth mindset is a tool for learning and improvement. It&#8217;s not just a vehicle for making children feel good.&#8217;</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>But there is another factor at work here. The failure to translate the growth mindset into the classroom might reflect a misunderstanding of the nature of teaching and learning itself. Growth mindset supporters David Yeager and Gregory Walton claim that interventions should be delivered in a subtle way to maximise their effectiveness. They say that if adolescents perceive a teacher&#8217;s intervention as conveying that they are in need of help, this could undo its intended effects.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>A lot of what drives students is their innate beliefs and how they perceive themselves. There is a strong correlation between self-perception and achievement, but there is evidence to suggest that the actual effect of achievement on self-perception is stronger than the other way round. To stand up in a classroom and successfully deliver a good speech is a genuine achievement, and that is likely to be more powerfully motivating than vague notions of &#8216;motivation&#8217; itself.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Recent evidence would suggest that growth mindset interventions are not the elixir of student learning that its proponents claim it to be. The growth mindset appears to be a viable construct in the lab, which, when administered in the classroom via targeted interventions, doesn&#8217;t seem to work. It is hard to dispute that having faith in the capacity to change is a good attribute for students. Paradoxically, however, that aspiration is not well served by direct interventions that try to instil it.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Motivational posters and talks are often a waste of time, and might well give students a deluded notion of what success actually means. Teaching concrete skills such as how to write an effective introduction to an essay then praising students&#8217; effort in getting there is probably a far better way of improving confidence than telling them how unique they are, or indeed how capable they are of changing their own brains. Perhaps growth mindset works best as a philosophy and not an intervention.</span><br></div>",

Wegener proposed this theory in 1912 and developed it extensively for nearly 20 years. His book on the subject, The Origin of Continents and Oceans, went through four editions and was the focus of an international controversy in his lifetime and for some years after his death.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Wegener&#8217;s basic idea was that many mysteries about the Earth&#8217;s history could be solved if one supposed that the continents moved laterally, rather than supposing that they remained fixed in place. Wegener showed in great detail how such continental movements were plausible and how they worked, using evidence from a large number of sciences including geology, geophysics, paleontology, and climatology. Wegener&#8217;s idea &#8211; that the continents move &#8211; is at the heart of the theory that guides Earth sciences today: namely plate tectonics. Plate tectonics is in many respects quite different from Wegener&#8217;s proposal, in the same way that modern evolutionary theory is very different from the ideas Charles Darwin proposed in the 1850s about biological evolution. Yet plate tectonics is a descendant of Alfred Wegener&#8217;s theory of continental drift, in quite the same way that modern evolutionary theory is a descendant of Darwin&#8217;s theory of natural selection.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>When I started writing about Wegener&#8217;s life and work, one of the most intriguing things about him for me was that, although he came up with a theory on continental drift, he was not a geologist. He trained as an astronomer and pursued a career in atmospheric physics. When he proposed the theory of continental displacements in 1912, he was a lecturer in physics and astronomy at the University of Marburg, in southern Germany. However, he was not an &#8216;unknown&#8217;. In 1906 he had set a world record (with his brother Kurt) for time aloft in a hot-air balloon: 52 hours. Between 1906 and 1908 he had taken part in a highly publicized and extremely dangerous expedition to the coast of northeast Greenland. He had also made a name for himself amongst a small circle of meteorologists and atmospheric physicists in Germany as the author of a textbook, Thermodynamics of the Atmosphere (1911), and of a number of interesting scientific papers.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>As important as Wegener&#8217;s work on continental drift has turned out to be, it was largely a sideline to his interest in atmospheric physics, geophysics, and paleoclimatology*, and thus I have been at great pains to put Wegener&#8217;s work on continental drift in the larger context of his other scientific work, and in the even larger context of atmospheric sciences in his lifetime. This is a &#8216;continental drift book&#8217; only to the extent that Wegener was interested in that topic and later became famous for it. My treatment of his other scientific work is no less detailed, though I certainly have devoted more attention to the reception of his ideas on continental displacement, as they were much more controversial than his other work.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Readers interested in the specific detail of Wegener&#8217;s career will see that he often stopped pursuing a given line of investigation (sometimes for years on end), only to pick it up later. I have tried to provide guideposts to his rapidly shifting interests by characterizing different phases of his life as careers in different sciences, which is reflected in the titles of the chapters. Thus, the index should be a sufficient guide for those interested in a particular aspect of Wegener&#8217;s life but perhaps not all of it. My own feeling, however, is that the parts do not make as much sense on their own as do all of his activities taken together. In this respect I urge readers to try to experience Wegener&#8217;s life as he lived it, with all the interruptions, changes of mind, and renewed efforts this entailed.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Wegener left behind a few published works but, as was standard practice, these reported the results of his work &#8211; not the journey he took to reach that point. Only a few hundred of the many thousands of letters he wrote and received in his lifetime have survived and he didn&#8217;t keep notebooks or diaries that recorded his life and activities. He was not active (with a few exceptions) in scientific societies, and did not seek to find influence or advance his ideas through professional contacts and politics, spending most of his time at home in his study reading and writing, or in the field collecting observations.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Some famous scientists, such as Newton, Darwin, and Einstein, left mountains of written material behind, hundreds of notebooks and letters numbering in the tens of thousands. Others, like Michael Faraday, left extensive journals of their thoughts and speculations, parallel to their scientific notebooks. The more such material a scientist leaves behind, the better chance a biographer has of forming an accurate picture of how a scientist&#8217;s ideas took shape and evolved.<br></span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div>I am firmly of the opinion that most of us, Wegener included, are not in any real sense the authors of our own lives. We plan, think, and act, often with apparent freedom, but most of the time our lives &#8216;happen to us&#8217;, and we only retrospectively turn this happenstance into a coherent narrative of fulfilled intentions. This book, therefore, is a story both of the life and scientific work that Alfred Wegener planned and intended and of the life and scientific work that actually &#8216;happened to him&#8217;. These are, as I think you will soon see, not always the same thing.<br></div><div><br></div><div>----------</div><div><br></div><div>* Paleoclimatology &#8211; The study of past climates</div>",

          "content": "<b>The oak trees in Britain</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Oak trees, which have a special place in folklore in many parts of Europe, are associated with the gods of thunder and lightning in Greek, Roman and Celtic mythology. This link may in part be due to the towering habit of the oak tree, which has made it susceptible to being struck by lightning, standing out as it does from the surrounding trees.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Among the approximately 60 trees native to Britain are two indigenous species of oak: the English oak (Quercus robur) and the Sessile oak (Quercus petraea), both of which are deciduous and flower in late spring. The former favours fertile lowland soils and the latter less fertile and wetter soils on higher ground.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The English oak, the most common British tree species, represents strength and endurance as reflected in its Latin name. It has been celebrated in folklore and in coinage with the 2012 &#163;5 official coin featuring the leaf and acorn of the oak tree. The species can probably lay claim to being the most famous in Britain, where its leaves are a national symbol. The English oak can grow to a height of 35 metres with a rounded head and spreading habit of up to 30 metres in diameter, while the Sessile oak can grow to a height of 40 metres with a spreading habit of 25 metres. The flowers in both trees are borne in yellow green catkins. The leaves of the English oak have very short stalks and are alternate on the branches, but have long-stalked acorns, held tightly in cupules. The Sessile oak, by comparison, has long-stalked leaves, but short- stalked acorns. The acorns turn from green to brown in autumn and when loosened from the cupules fall to the ground below. Both trees have a grey bark with the English oak having deep vertical fissures, but ridges developing only in mature trees in the case of the Sessile oak.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Oak trees can live to more than 200 years with the oldest known, the Pontfadog Oak, a Sessile oak in Wales, being knocked over by winds in 2013. But despite their great age, according to the Woodland Trust in the UK, the oldest British tree, a yew tree known as the Fortingall Yew in Perthshire is considered to be more than 3,000 years old and may be considerably more.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Oak trees are invaluable habitats for a wide range of wildlife species with both types of oak being a habitat for more wildlife than other trees native to Britain. More than 250 different species of insects are found in oaks, providing food for other wildlife such as birds. Their bark is an ideal habitat for 300 or more species of lichen that have been found growing there. Their cavities and branches also provide a home for birds and bats and in autumn the ground under the canopy of spreading oak branches provides a rich source of food for a wide variety of insects, such as beetles, and fungi. The 50,000 or more acorns produced by oak trees over their lifetime were once used for making flour for bread, but are now a welcome food for various birds and mammals, including the red squirrel, badger and mice.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Oak trees have also had some other important uses worth noting. Apart from their use in herbal medicine for the treatment of conditions such as diarrhoea and kidney stones, being a hard wood the timber of oak trees was once used in ship-building, but today its main use is in furniture-making, for floors in buildings, and firewood.<br></div><div><br></div><div>After a serious shortage of timber was identified during the First World War, the UK Forestry Commission was established in 1919 for the expansion and protection of woods in Britain. However, despite new forests being planted and private woodland being regenerated by the Commission, since the 1920s oak trees have been under serious threat. The foliage of the oak trees and their bark have been affected by the oak processionary moth, which is also a health hazard for humans, causing itching and respiratory problems. Two other diseases having an impact on the health of Britain&#8217;s oaks are Acute Oak Decline (AOD) and Chronic Oak Decline (COD), especially in southern and eastern England. The canopy of an affected tree is thinner than normal, the branches die back and black weeping wounds are found on the tree&#8217;s stems.&#160;Britain&#8217;s oak trees are in danger of suffering the same fate as the ancient woodland that once covered Britain and Europe, unless they are given greater protection not only from diseases, but also from the impact of shrinking habits and pollution as the result of the human development.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Ice harvested in Norway</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>In the days prior to mechanical refrigeration, in many countries with mild climates ice was a prized commodity available only to commercial enterprises and large houses with sufficient facilities for ice production in ponds and for storage. Up to the 1840s, for example, the ice available in London, restricted by the climate, was collected from lakes, and even canals such as the Regent&#8217;s Canal, which runs through central London. The ice, however, was of questionable quality.<br></div><div><br></div><div>As demand grew, ice was shipped from the United States to supply the needs of merchants. That was the case until a Swiss entrepreneur by the name of Carlo Gatti, working in the London catering trade, brought a shipment of 400 tons of ice to London in 1857 from Norway. Norway then became the dominant provider of ice to London until the end of the century when mechanical refrigeration appeared on the scene. Without fridges, however, Gatti had to ensure the ice would not melt, so he had two ice wells built in Wharf Road near King&#8217;s Cross.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The ice from Norway started its life in frozen lakes, some of them artificially made for the purpose of harvesting. Ice is produced when water starts freezing at 40&#160; &#778;F, or 5&#160; &#778;C, but in order to be harvested the frozen ice needs to be around a minimum of half a metre thick, both to create large enough blocks for harvesting and to support the weight of workers and horses involved in the process. The ice cutting was typically carried out at night when the ice was thicker.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The optimum harvest time in Norway was between December and February when the ice was sufficiently thick to be cut. Mild winters could result in ice famines, with one such event occurring in Norway in 1898 seriously affecting the UK ice market.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The quality of the ice varied with the hardest and clearest being reserved for table use and the rest for the commercial world. This seasonal work provided useful employment at a quiet time of the year.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Ice harvesting required a range of specialist tools, including chisels, ice saws and grapples, and protective equipment, such as special shoes for both the workers and horses. At the beginning of the ice harvest, the surface of the area on a lake selected for harvesting was cleaned of snow, and the ice thickness&#160;was tested. This cleaned area was marked out by a worker and a horse pulling a cutter, much like a slim plough, with parallel blades that created long grooves in the lake surface. The ice was then cut along these grooves using metal handsaws. The blocks needed to be manageable for workers lifting and dragging them using the grapples.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The size of individual blocks varied according to their final destination with the smallest being about half a metre square. As about a quarter of the ice could be lost from melting during transport and storage, the further away the destination, the larger the individual blocks needed to be.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In Norway, the artificial lakes for ice harvesting were close to the sea for ease of export. Once the ice blocks were floated to the lake shore, they were lifted out of the water using the grapples and slid along the ice to special slides, which formed a wooden railway carrying the ice down to the docks, where they were loaded onto ships bound for London. Once they reached the London docks, the blocks of ice were unloaded onto horse-drawn barges, and taken along the canal to the underground ice wells in Wharf Road at King&#8217;s Cross. There they could be kept for months until they were needed.<br></div><div><br></div><div>As the demand for ice grew, a host of related industries grew up around the ice trade. Apart from the production of the specialist tools and clothing, manuals were printed on how to create artificial lakes for ice harvesting; and special ships and train wagons for delivery of the ice were built among other new developments. The growth of the ice trade also affected the timber industry, as otherwise useless sawdust became a valuable commodity for packing and storing ice during transport.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The ice itself was much sought after by meat and fish sellers, and by pharmacists for various other purposes, including medicine to alleviate sprains and inflammation. But one particular consequence of the shipping of cheaper ice from Norway to London, for which Carlo Gatti is credited, is the introduction and growth of large-scale ice cream production, which prior to this had been the preserve of a few.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In the end, mechanical refrigeration removed the need to transport ice, but this new process led to the relative ease of the production, storage and distribution of ice cream.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The age of automation</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Automation is gathering pace around the world. Should we fear or embrace and control it?<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>A.&#160;</b><span>Automation as a term only gained wide currency after the late 1940s when a department devoted to automation was set up within the motor company Ford. Then other organisations began to follow suit. Automation, in modern terms, is a process where systems such as those in telephony, in manufacturing production, for example automobiles and machine parts, are controlled by machines, with limited need for human involvement. Other examples of similar systems that can be controlled automatically are heating systems, and processes such as robotic assistants, cleaners, and banking systems, with the number of areas now increasing at a hectic pace.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>B.&#160;</b></span><span>Automation is driven by a variety of interconnected factors. Economic gain is the primary reason that most are likely to give as the impetus behind any development in the field. The human desire for improvement, the joy of creating something new, the development of innovative processes and essentially the competitive side of the creative human process, are also important factors. Another factor is the desire to make life more convenient and comfortable. To have a chance of catching on as a desirable product, many new inventions in the automation field that are outside the gaze of the public eye, such as computerised banking systems, have only to pass the test of functionality. But if a product such as a personal robot requires direct human interaction, it must have some aesthetic appeal.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>C.&#160;</b><span>New discoveries have always shaped society with different types of jobs being created, then lost and new ones being generated. For example, the process involved in making a telephone call in the early days of telephony now seems very cumbersone to people today. The caller had to contact an operator, who then connected the caller to someone at the other end of the line. A significant milestone in the history of telephony, and hence modern day automation, was reached in the early 1900s when telephone exchanges became automated with the introduction of dial telephones. Prior to automation, operators were a necessity, but as customers wishing to make calls transmitted the telephone number to an automatic switching system, these workers were replaced with electromechanical systems. Dialing numbers was then replaced with pushing buttons, and buttons with touch screens on smartphones. One wonders how much longer it will be before touch screens are superseded by touching the air, as virtual reality headsets dispense with machines like computer screens, landline phones and mobiles altogether.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>D.&#160;&#160;</b></span><span>As the process of telephony has developed, the new jobs to build and operate the system created in its early days have disappeared. Over time, telephony has evolved with the constant creation of new professions that range across invention, design, manufacturing and then maintenance of new systems and also embrace computerised and digital systems, with increasing input from a wide range of creative and entertainment media.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>E.&#160;</b></span><span>The latest developments in 3-D printing promise even further revolutionary developments in all fields, not just industry, as such devices print not only physical structures, but circuitry for using advanced digital systems. The impact on manufacturing jobs could be huge with production costs being reduced, but new avenues and opportunities will open up as greater numbers of creative designers and engineers to create, build and then service the equipment become essential. Further, as with all such developments, new professions that are now unforeseen will be created.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>F.&#160; </b>It is not surprising that people&#8217;s attention is drawn to job losses with the spread of automation. Current predictions of job losses running into millions, if not tens of millions, of internet posts worldwide do not paint a rosy picture of the future. Yet if history is anything to go by, the human race should feel more positive about the world to come. What is, perhaps, different now and is more menacing for the general public is the fact that technology is introducing changes in all directions at the same time, not just by way of automation, and it is, therefore, more disruptive.<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>G.&#160;</b> What is surprising is that around the world working environments are suffering from a lack of appropriately skilled workers to meet the very technological changes by way of more specialised technical jobs in the creative industries, for example, that are being thrown up by automation. Governments, companies and individuals need to rise to the challenge and seize the opportunities with the former putting more money, effort and strategic leadership into preparing workers for the workplaces and careers of the future. As well as skills training, help for workers with guidance in being flexible and willing to adapt and manage change is vital. If the workers of the future are to flourish, they must not leave the future to chance, but embrace and control the age of automation.<br></span></div>",

She was the first woman to receive a doctor of science degree in France, the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, the first woman to lecture at the Sorbonne, the first person to win two Nobel Prizes, and the first Nobel Laureate whose child also won a Nobel Prize. Her life offers insights into the changing role of women in science and academia over the past century.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Although Marie&#8217;s family was not wealthy, both parents were teachers and instilled in their children a love of learning and a deep patriotism, which led to her opposing the Russian occupation of her country. At the time of her birth, Poland was not an independent country and Warsaw was in the part of Poland that was under the control of Russia. Czar Alexander II, the then ruler of Russia, hoped to stamp out Polish nationalism by keeping the people ignorant of their culture and language, and schools were strictly controlled. Although Marie did very well in her school studies, her early days did not show any startling characteristic to indicate that one day she would become the most famous woman scientist in the world.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Marie, along with her sister, Bronya, started attending the Floating University. The name &#8216;Floating University&#8217; derived from the fact that it was an illegal night school and its classes met in changing locations to evade the watchful eyes of the Russian authorities. It was obvious that the education given by the Floating University could not match the education provided by any major European university. Both Marie and her sister nurtured a hope of going to Paris to study at the Sorbonne University, however, their father was not in a position to send them to Paris for higher studies. Both the sisters realised that individually, they did not have enough resources to enable them to go to Paris, so they decided that one of them would go first by pulling their resources together. Bronya went first, as she was the older sister and they agreed that Bronya would fund Marie after her graduation as a doctor. Marie worked several years as a governess to finance her older sister&#8217;s studies at the Sorbonne. In 1890, Bronya graduated and a year later, Marie began her university degree in Paris. At graduation, one of two women in a graduating class of several thousand, Curie ranked first in physics.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>After graduation, Marie returned to Poland, as she intended to work there and care for her father. However, she was persuaded by fellow scientist Pierre Curie to return to Paris. Pierre wrote, &#8220;It would be a beautiful thing if we could spend our lives near each other. Hypnotized by our dreams - your patriotic dream, our humanitarian dream and our scientific dream.&#8221; Pierre and Marie married and began their historic collaboration on the nature of radioactivity at a small institute out of the mainstream of the scientific establishment.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>In 1896, Becquerel had shown that uranium compounds, even if they were kept in the dark, emitted rays that would fog a photographic plate. This was an accidental discovery, as he was trying to find out whether the new radioactivity discovered by Roentgen could have a connection with fluorescence. The scientific community initially ignored Becquerel&#8217;s intriguing finding. Marie, however, decided to make a systematic investigation of the mysterious uranium rays for her doctorate degree. Marie found that two uranium minerals, pitchblende and chalcocite, were more active than uranium itself, so she hypothesised that a new element that was considerably more active than uranium was present in small amounts.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Working in the small institute with Pierre, Marie had an independence she might not have had at the Sorbonne, where she probably would have been expected to elaborate some superior&#8217;s work. In their joint work, Pierre observed the properties of the radiation, while Marie purified the radioactive elements. By July 1903, they had isolated a new element, and they wrote, &#8220;We propose to call it polonium after the name of the country of origin of one of us.&#8221; Soon they had isolated another new element, radium. Both the new elements were much more radioactive than uranium and their discoveries brought the Curies international fame with the awarding of the Nobel Prize in 1903.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Following Pierre&#8217;s death in a road accident in 1906, Marie&#8217;s status changed again. Now she was a celebrated woman of accomplishment without a husband to make the celebrity acceptable. Marie was appointed as a professor at the Sorbonne University, but her application for membership in the Academy of Sciences in 1910 was rejected, and there can be little doubt she was refused because she was a woman. After this humiliation, Marie became involved in a romantic scandal, but, in spite of public outrage and the objections of some members of the Swedish Academy, Marie received her second Nobel Prize in 1911.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Over the next 20 or so years, Marie worked with radioactive elements and, because the dangers of working with them were not fully understood at that time, the long exposure led to her sickness and death from a type of leukaemia at the age of 66. The amount of radiation she was exposed to is shown by the fact that her old papers and even her cookbook from a hundred years ago are still too dangerous to handle without specialised protective clothing.</span><br></span></div>",

          "content": "<b>Tidal Energy</b><div><br></div><div>Tidal energy is a form of hydropower that utilises large amounts of power within the ocean&#8217;s tides to generate electricity. Tidal energy is a renewable energy source, as the Earth uses the gravitational forces of both the moon and the sun everyday to move vast quantities of water around the oceans to produce tides.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There are different kinds of tidal power systems. A tidal barrage is a type of tidal power generation that involves the construction of a fairly low dam wall, known as a &#8216;barrage&#8217;, across the entrance of a tidal inlet or basin, creating a tidal reservoir. This dam has a number of underwater tunnels cut into its width allowing seawater to flow through them in a controllable way, using a sluice gate on the sea and reservoir side, which can slide down or up to release or retain water as desired. Fixed within the tunnels are propellers that are turned by the tidal flow and they in turn spin a turbine. The movement creates a magnetic field within the generator above, which is converted to electricity.<br></div><div><br></div><div>One disadvantage of tidal barrage electricity generation is that it can only generate electricity when the tide is actually flowing either in or out, as during high and low tide times the tidal water is stationary. However, as the tides are completely predictable, it is straightforward to plan how to compensate for low generation times with other providers in the energy mix. Supporters of tidal power also point out that other renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind farms, are much more unpredictable and intermittent. Other disadvantages of a tidal barrage system are the high construction costs and the environmental effects that a long concrete dam may have on the estuary it spans.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A tidal stream generation system reduces some of the environmental effects of tidal barrages by using turbine generators beneath the surface of the water. Major tidal flows and ocean currents, like the Gulf Stream, can be exploited to extract their tidal energy, using underwater rotors and turbines. Tidal stream generation is very similar in principal to wind power generation, except this time, water currents flow across a turbine&#8217;s rotor blades that rotate the turbine, much like how wind currents turn the blades for wind power turbines. In fact, tidal stream generation areas on the seabed can look just like underwater wind farms.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Unlike offshore wind power turbines, which can suffer from storms or heavy sea damage, tidal stream turbines operate just below the sea surface or are fixed to the seabed. Tidal streams are formed by the horizontal fast flowing volumes of water caused by the ebb and flow of the tide, as the profile of the seabed causes the water to speed up as it approaches the shoreline. As water is much denser than air and has a much slower flow rate, tidal stream turbines have much smaller diameters and higher tip speed rates compared to an equivalent wind turbine. One of the disadvantages of tidal stream generation is that, as the turbines are submerged under the surface of the water, they can create hazards to navigation and shipping.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A good example of a successful tidal power project is the La Rance power station in France. This tidal barrage is still the largest tidal power station in the world, in terms of installed capacity, with a peak rating of 240 megawatts generated by its 24 turbines, and an annual output of approximately 600 gigawatts. The development costs were significant, even back in 1966 when it was opened, but these have now been recovered and electricity production costs are lower than that of nuclear power. The high cost of tidal barrages, however, is what has discouraged the further construction of similar projects.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The environment at La Rance has remained healthy, but there have been changes. The barrage has caused limited silting of the Rance ecosystem, although this has been manageable. Sand eels and plaice have reduced in numbers, but sea bass and cuttlefish have returned to the river. The tidal flows are regulated in the estuary by the operators, who adjust them to minimise the biological impact.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The La Rance tidal plant produces a source of energy that is clean, renewable and sustainable. It has no impact on climate, because it does not emit any greenhouse gases. The pattern of the tides is preserved, so that the impact on species living in the estuary is minimal. The operator monitors the tides and weather forecasts to program the barrage operations on a weekly basis.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Since the construction of the barrage, a new ecological equilibrium has been established in the Rance estuary and there is an abundance of fish, bird and other wild life. The mean water level in the lagoon is higher than it was before the construction, which has promoted an increase in boating and sailing activities. The facility attracts approximately 70,000 visitors per year and a canal lock in the west end of the dam permits the passage of 20,000 vessels each year between the English Channel and the Rance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Tidal power offers society a clean and renewable source of energy. Although technology is still at a relatively immature stage, economic projections indicate that tidal energy could become cost- competitive over the long-term and governments should explore potential sites for taking advantage of these natural opportunities.<br></div>",

With soaring crime rates being made up mostly of re-offenders, people are questioning the effectiveness of prisons and whether there are viable options to replace or work in conjunction with them.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There seems to be confusion as to what exactly prison is for. Prison director, Katherine Soames, has mixed feelings about her establishment&#8217;s purpose. &#8220;Some say prison is for punishment, but prison is an oblique and expensive way of punishing people. Heavy fines would surely give back more to society than having them languish in a cell. Some say deterrence is the main factor, but there is little evidence of such an effect. Hardened criminals do not fear prison and short prison sentences are probably counterproductive in that they operate as &#8216;schools for crime&#8217;. As for rehabilitation, prisons stigmatise people, sever family ties and make it more difficult to get employment on release.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another reason sometimes given for putting people in prison is retribution, the argument being that people should &#8216;have to pay for what they have done&#8217;. Unfortunately, this often penalises people for the consequences of their behaviour, regardless of whether harm was intended. If a driver falls asleep at the wheel and causes the death of ten people, he has no more criminal intent than if he hit a tree and injured himself. He is not dangerous after his driving licence has been taken away, but a man was recently sentenced to five years in prison for this. Prosecutor Angela Martin comments on this case. &#8220;While prison might please the relatives of those killed, it is unnecessary for the protection of society and expensive to the taxpayer. I believe the only proper use of prison is for the containment of dangerous criminals, including violent men and serial burglars who cannot be reformed.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Can prison be of use at rehabilitation? Ministry of Justice executive, Colin Case, explains some facts. &#8220;Recidivism figures give little cause for optimism regarding the effectiveness of short- or medium-term prison sentences. Ministry of Justice figures show that a crime is committed every 10 minutes by a criminal on bail.&#8221; Other figures support Case. In the UK for example, one-third of those cautioned or convicted last year had at least 15 previous convictions and only ten per cent were first time offenders. One 66-year-old shoplifter had 330 convictions over fifty years and was still released immediately with a short prison sentence, because he had already served half of it while awaiting trial.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Can we predict in advance which criminals are likely to reoffend? Researchers have attempted to do so. Recently, a study measured impulse control while monitoring brain activity with an MRI. Error-related responses in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) indicative of impulsiveness were predictive of rearrest within the four years following release from prison. Those with low activity in the ACC were about twice as likely to be recidivists. The researcher in charge of the study, Sophie Meaker, comments on the results. &#8220;While our study gives us some data to help guide our actions with regard to&#160;reoffending, they are still not accurate enough for determining life-altering decisions with respect to individuals.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>One possible more humane alternative to prison and one of the best is community service. This has elements of punishment (deprivation of freedom and some degree of humiliation), reparation (payback to the community) and rehabilitation (it maintains community ties and promotes a work ethic). Jason Howell, a judge in Australia, is a fan. &#8220;It is better than short-term prison sentences at reducing reoffending and allows monitoring without a prison sentence. It can take the pressure off the prison system, yet still enforce justice.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another answer to the over-crowding and ineffectiveness of prison is to turn to electronic tagging, which is the attachment of a transmitter to an offender, usually to the ankle. A control centre can monitor the whereabouts and movements of anyone wearing a tag. This can and ought to be used as a sentence in itself or part of an early release system. It can enforce many of the benefits of prison by requiring offenders to be at home for certain specified hours of the day or night, without incurring the expense of running the prison.<br></div><div><br></div><div>John Dawson, a US child psychologist, explains one key benefit. &#8220;Electronic tagging can be of immeasurable benefit for young offenders. Instead of being sent to a young offenders&#8217; institute, where they might mix and learn bad habits from other offenders, they can remain in society with their families, and still be monitored. Many young people are very scared by the repercussions of what they have done and keeping them away from negative role models can be enough to allow them to avoid a life of crime.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Research has suggested that electronic tagging would create significant monetary savings, although so far, conclusions have only been based on extrapolating the results of limited trials. There has also been some criticism. Activist Tom Wilkinson argues that tagging should be illegal. &#8220;Tagging clearly contravenes a couple of basic human rights, such as the right not to undergo degrading treatment or the right to a private family life. Tagged prisoners have frequently complained of being stigmatised and treated like animals.&#8221; Parole officer, Alison Headley, opposes tagging for almost an opposite reason. &#8220;Tagging is a soft option and one that most prisoners, especially re-offenders, would prefer. It does not punish sufficiently or effectively and does not discourage re-offending.&#8221; When taking this into account, it seems that tagging is not a suitable measure for re-offenders.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Whatever one&#8217;s point of view, finding the right solution to the punishment system in today&#8217;s society is still open to debate. Prison will continue to be widely used, but there will be constant efforts to find alternatives that can punish effectively in an economic way.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Recidivism &#8211; A return to criminal behaviour.</div><div>MRI &#8211; Magnetic resonance imaging.</div><div>Parole &#8211; The conditional release of a prisoner with certain agreed requirements.</div></div>",

          "content": "<b>Why we need to protect polar bears&#160;</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><div>Polar bears are being increasingly threatened by the effects of climate change, but their disappearance could have far-reaching consequences. They are uniquely adapted to the extreme conditions of the Arctic Circle, where temperatures can reach &#8212;40&#176;C. One reason for this is that they have up to 11 centimetres of fat underneath their skin. Humans with comparative levels of adipose tissue would be considered obese and would be likely to suffer from diabetes and heart disease. Yet the polar bear experiences no such consequences.&#160;</div><div><br></div></div><div>A 2014 study by Shi Ping Liu and colleagues sheds light on this mystery. They compared the genetic structure of polar bears with that of their closest relatives from a warmer climate, the brown bears. This allowed them to determine the genes that have allowed polar bears to survive in one of the toughest environments on Earth. Liu and his colleagues found the polar bears had a gene known as APoB, which reduces levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) &#8212; a form of 'bad' cholesterol. In humans, mutations of this gene are associated with increased risk of heart disease. Polar bears may therefore be an important study model to understand heart disease in humans.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The genome of the polar bear may also provide the solution for another condition, one that particularly affects our older generation: osteoporosis. This is a disease where bones show reduced density, usually caused by insufficient exercise, reduced calcium intake or food starvation. Bone tissue is constantly being remodelled, meaning that bone is added or removed, depending on nutrient availability and the stress that the bone is under. Female polar bears, however, undergo extreme conditions during every pregnancy. Once autumn comes around, these females will dig maternity dens in the snow and will remain there throughout the winter, both before and after the birth of their cubs. This process results in about six months of fasting, where the female bears have to keep themselves and their cubs alive, depleting their own calcium and calorie reserves. Despite this, their bones remain strong and dense.&#160;<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>Physiologists Alanda Lennox and Allen Goodship found an explanation for this paradox in 2008. They discovered that pregnant bears were able to increase the density of their bones before they started to build their dens. In addition, six months later, when they finally emerged from the den with their cubs, there was no evidence of significant loss of bone density. Hibernating brown bears do not have this capacity and must therefore resort to major bone reformation in the following spring. If the mechanism of bone remodelling in polar bears can be understood, many bedridden humans, and even astronauts, could potentially benefit.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div><div>The medical benefits of the polar bear for humanity certainly have their importance in our conservation efforts, but these should not be the only factors taken into consideration. We tend to want to protect animals we think are intelligent and possess emotions, such as elephants and primates. Bears, on the other hand, seem to be perceived as stupid and in many cases violent. And yet anecdotal evidence from the field challenges those assumptions, suggesting for example that polar bears have good problem-solving abilities. A male bear called GoGo in Tennoji Zoo, Osaka, has even been observed making use of a tool to manipulate his environment. The bear used a tree branch on multiple occasions to dislodge a piece of meat hung out of his reach. Problem-solving ability has also been witnessed in wild polar bears, although not as obviously as with GoGo. A calculated move by a male bear involved running and jumping onto barrels in an attempt to get to a photographer standing on a platform four metres high.&#160;</div></div><div><br></div><div>In other studies, such as one by Alison Ames in 2008, polar bears showed deliberate and focussed manipulation. For example, Ames observed bears putting objects in piles and then knocking them over in what appeared to be a game. The study demonstrates that bears are capable of agile and thought-out behaviours. These examples suggest bears have greater creativity and problem-solving abilities than previously thought.&#160;<br></div><div><br></div><div>As for emotions, while the evidence is once again anecdotal, many bears have been seen to hit out at ice and snow &#8212; seemingly out of frustration &#8212; when they have just missed out on a kill. Moreover, polar bears can form unusual relationships with other species, including playing with the dogs used to pull sleds in the Arctic. Remarkably, one hand-raised polar bear called Agee has formed a close relationship with her owner Mark Dumas to the point where they even swim together. This is even more astonishing since polar bears are known to actively hunt humans in the wild.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div>If climate change were to lead to their extinction, this would mean not only the loss of potential breakthroughs in human medicine, but more importantly, the disappearance of an intelligent, majestic animal.&#160;</div></div><div><br></div></div>",

The pyramids are the most famous monuments of ancient Egypt and still hold enormous interest for people in the present day. These grand, impressive tributes to the memory of the Egyptian kings have become linked with the country even though other cultures, such as the Chinese and Mayan, also built pyramids. The evolution of the pyramid form has been written and argued about for centuries. However, there is no question that, as far as Egypt is concerned, it began with one monument to one king designed by one brilliant architect: the Step Pyramid of Djoser at Saqqara.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>B. </b>Djoser was the first king of the Third Dynasty of Egypt and the first to build in stone. Prior to Djoscr's reign, tombs were rectangular monuments made of dried clay brick, which covered underground passages where the deceased person was buried. For reasons which remain unclear, Djoser's main official, whose name was Imhotep, conceived of building a taller, more impressive tomb for his king by stacking stone slabs on top of one another, progressively making them smaller, to form the shape now known as the Step Pyramid. Djoser is thought to have reigned for 19 years, but some historians and scholars attribute a much longer time for his rule, owing to the number and size of the monuments he built.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>C.&#160;</b>The Step Pyramid has been thoroughly examined and investigated over the last century, and it is now known that the building process went through many different stages. Historian Marc Van de Mieroop comments on this, writing &#8216;Much experimentation was involved, which is especially clear in the construction of the pyramid in the centre of the complex. It had several plans ... before it became the first Step Pyramid in history, piling six levels on top of one another ... The weight of the enormous mass was a challenge for the builders, who placed the stones at an inward incline in order to prevent the monument breaking up.&#8217;</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>D.&#160;</b>When finally completed, the Step Pyramid rose 62 metres high and was the tallest structure of its time. The complex in which it was built was the size of a city in ancient Egypt and included a temple, courtyards, shrines, and living quarters for the priests. It covered a region of 16 hectares and was surrounded by a wall 10.5 metres high. The wall had 13 false doors cut into it with only one true entrance cut into the south-east corner; the entire wall was then ringed by a trench 750 meters long and 40 metres wide. The false doors and the trench were incorporated into the complex to discourage unwanted visitors. If someone wished to enter, he or she would have needed to know in advance how to find the location of the true opening in the wall. Djoser was so proud of his accomplishment that he broke the tradition of having only his own name on the monument and had Imhotep's name carved on it as well.&#160;</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>E. </b>The burial chamber of the tomb, where the king's body was laid to rest, was dug beneath the base of the pyramid, surrounded by a vast maze of long tunnels that had rooms off them to discourage robbers. One of the most mysterious discoveries found inside the pyramid was a large number of stone vessels. Over 40,000 of these vessels, of various forms and shapes, were discovered in storerooms off the pyramid's underground passages. They are inscribed with the names of rulers from the First and Second Dynasties of Egypt and made from different kinds of stone. There is no agreement among scholars and archaeologists on why the vessels were placed in the tomb of Djoser or what they were supposed to represent. The archaeologist Jean-Philippe Lauer, who excavated most of the pyramid and complex, believes they were originally stored and then given a 'proper burial' by Djoser in his pyramid to honor his predecessors. There are other historians; however, who claim the vessels were dumped into the shafts as yet another attempt to prevent grave robbers from getting to the king's burial chamber.</span></div><div><span><br></span><span><b>F.&#160;</b>Unfortunately, all of the precautions and intricate design of the underground network did not prevent ancient robbers from finding a way in. Djoser's grave goods, and even his body, were stolen at some point in the past and all archaeologists found were a small number of his valuables overlooked by the thieves. There was enough left throughout the pyramid and its complex;, however, to astonish and amaze the archaeologists who excavated it.</span></div><div><br><b>G.</b> Egyptologist Miroslav Verner writes, 'Few monuments hold a place in human history as significant as that of the Step Pyramid in Saqqara. It can be said without exaggeration that this pyramid complex constitutes a milestone in the evolution of monumental stone architecture in Egypt and in the world as a whole.' The Step Pyramid was a revolutionary advance in architecture and became the archetype which all the other great pyramid builders of Egypt would follow.&#160;<br></div>",

          "content": "<div><b>The future of work&#160;</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>According to a leading business consultancy, 3-14% of the global workforce will need to switch to a different occupation within the next 10-15 years, and all workers will need to adapt as their occupations evolve alongside increasingly capable machines. Automation &#8212; or 'embodied artificial intelligence (Al) &#8212; is one aspect of the disruptive effects of technology on the labour market. 'Disembodied Al', like the algorithms running in our smartphones, is another.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr Stella Pachidi from Cambridge Judge Business School believes that some of the most fundamental changes are happening as a result of the 'algorithmication' of jobs that are dependent on data rather than on production &#8212; the so-called knowledge economy. Algorithms are capable of learning from data to undertake tasks that previously needed human judgement. such as reading legal contracts, analysing medical scans and gathering market intelligence.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;In many cases, they can outperform humans,&#8217; says Pachidi. &#8216;Organisations are attracted to using algorithms because they want to make choices based on what they consider is &#34;perfect information&#34;, as well as to reduce costs and enhance productivity.&#8217;&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;But these enhancements are not without consequences,&#8217; says Pachidi. 'If routine cognitive tasks are taken over by Al, how do professions develop their future experts?' she asks. &#8216;One way of learning about a job is &#34;legitimate peripheral participation&#34;&#8212; a novice stands next to experts and learns by observation. If this isn't happening, then you need to find new ways to learn.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Another issue is the extent to which the technology influences or even controls the workforce. For over two years, Pachidi monitored a telecommunications company. 'The way telecoms salespeople work is through personal and frequent contact with clients, using the benefit of experience to assess a situation and reach a decision. However, the company had started using a [n] ... algorithm that defined when account managers should contact certain customers about which kinds of campaigns and what to offer them.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>The algorithm &#8212; usually built by external designers &#8212; often becomes the keeper of knowledge, she explains. In cases like this, Pachidi believes, a short-sighted view begins to creep into working practices whereby workers learn through the 'algorithm's eyes' and become dependent on its instructions. Alternative explorations &#8212; where experimentation and human instinct lead to progress and new ideas &#8212; are effectively discouraged.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Pachidi and colleagues even observed people developing strategies to make the algorithm work to their own advantage. 'We are seeing cases where workers feed the algorithm with false data to reach their targets,' she reports.</div><div><br></div><div>It's scenarios like these that many researchers am working to avoid. Their objective is to make Al technologies more trustworthy and transparent, so that organisations and individuals understand how Al decisions are made. In the meantime, says Pachidi, 'We need to make sure we fully understand the dilemmas that this new world raises regarding expertise, occupational boundaries and control.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Economist Professor Hamish Low believes that the future of work will involve major transitions across the whole life course for everyone: 'The traditional trajectory of full-time education followed by full-time work followed by a pensioned retirement is a thing of the past,' says Low. Instead, he envisages a multistage employment life: one where retraining happens across the life course, and where multiple jobs and no job happen by choice at different stages.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>On the subject of job losses, Low believes the predictions are founded on a fallacy: 'It assumes that the number of jobs is fixed. If in 30 years, half of 100 jobs are being carried out by robots, that doesn't mean we are left with just 50 jobs for humans. The number of jobs will increase: we would expect there to be 150 jobs.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>Dr Ewan McGaughey. at Cambridge's Centre for Business Research and King's College London agrees that 'apocalyptic' views about the future of work are misguided. 'It's the laws that restrict the supply of capital to the job market, not the advent of new technologies that causes unemployment.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>His recently published research answers the question of whether automation. Al and robotics will mean a 'jobless future' by looking at the causes of unemployment. &#8216;History is clear that change can mean redundancies. But social policies can tackle this through retraining and redeployment.'&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>He adds: 'If there is going to be change to jobs as a result of Al and robotics then I'd like to see governments seizing the opportunity to improve policy to enforce good job security. We can reprogramme the law to prepare for a fairer future of work and leisure.' McGaughey's findings are a call to arms to leaders of organisations, governments and banks to pre-empt the coming changes with bold new policies that guarantee full employment, fair incomes and a thriving economic democracy.&#160;</div><div><br></div><div>'The promises of these new technologies are astounding. They deliver humankind the capacity to live in a way that nobody could have once imagined.' he adds. &#8216;Just as the industrial revolution brought people past subsistence agriculture, and the corporate revolution enabled mass production, a third revolution has been pronounced. But it will not only be one of technology. The next revolution will be social.'&#160;</div><div><br></div>",

There are 56 hill figures scattered around England, with the vast majority on the chalk downlands of the country&#8217;s southern counties. The figures include giants, horses, crosses and regimental badges. Although the majority of these geoglyphs date within the last 300 years or so, there are one or two that are much older.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The most famous of these figures is perhaps also the most mysterious &#8211; the Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire. The White Horse has recently been re-dated and shown to be even older than its previously assigned ancient pre-Roman Iron Age* date. More controversial is the date of the enigmatic Long Man of Wilmington in Sussex. While many historians are convinced the figure is prehistoric, others believe that it was the work of an artistic monk from a nearby priory and was created between the 11th and 15th centuries.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The method of cutting these huge figures was simply to remove the overlying grass to reveal the gleaming white chalk below. However, the grass would soon grow over the geoglyph again unless it was regularly cleaned or scoured by a fairly large team of people. One reason that the vast majority of hill figures have disappeared is that when the traditions associated with the figures faded, people no longer bothered or remembered to clear away the grass to expose the chalk outline. Furthermore, over hundreds of years the outlines would sometimes change due to people not always cutting in exactly the same place, thus creating a different shape to the original geoglyph. That fact that any ancient hill figures survive at all in England today is testament to the strength and continuity of local customs and beliefs which, in one case at least, must stretch back over millennia.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Uffington White Horse is a unique, stylised representation of a horse consisting of a long, sleek back, thin disjointed legs, a streaming tail, and a bird-like beaked head. The elegant creature almost melts into the landscape. The horse is situated 2.5 km from Uffington village on a steep close to the Late Bronze Age* (c. 7th century BCE) hillfort of Uffington Castle and below the Ridgeway, a long-distance Neolithic** track.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Uffington Horse is also surrounded by Bronze Age burial mounds. It is not far from the Bronze Age cemetery of Lambourn Seven Barrows, which consists of more than 30 well-preserved burial mounds. The carving has been placed in such a way as to make it extremely difficult to see from close quarters, and like many geoglyphs is best appreciated from the air. Nevertheless, there are certain areas of the Vale of the White Horse, the valley containing and named after the enigmatic creature, from which an adequate impression may be gained. Indeed on a clear day the carving can be seen from up to 30 km away.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The earliest evidence of a horse at Uffington is from the 1070s CE when &#8216;White Horse Hill&#8217; is mentioned in documents from the nearby Abbey of Abingdon, and the first reference to the horse itself is soon after, in 1190 CE. However, the carving is believed to date back much further than that. Due to the similarity of the Uffington White Horse to the stylised depictions of horses on 1st century BCE coins, it had been thought that the creature must also date to that period.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>However, in 1995 Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) testing was carried out by the Oxford Archaeological Unit on soil from two of the lower layers of the horse&#8217;s body, and from another cut near the base. The result was a date for the horse&#8217;s construction somewhere between 1400 and 600 BCE &#8211; in other words, it had a Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age origin.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The latter end of this date range would tie the carving of the horse in with occupation of the nearby Uffington hillfort, indicating that it may represent a tribal emblem making the land of the inhabitants of the hillfort. Alternatively, the carving may have been carried out during a Bronze or Iron Age ritual. Some researchers see the horse as representing the Celtic*** horse goddess Epona, who was worshipped as a protector of horses, and for her associations with fertility. However, the cult of Epona was not imported from Gaul (France) until around the first century CE. This date is at least six centuries after the Uffington Horse was probably carved. Nevertheless, the horse had great ritual and economic significance during the Bronze and Iron Ages, as attested by its depictions on jewellery and other metal objects. It is possible that the carving represents a goddess in native mythology, such as Rhiannon, described in later Welsh mythology as a beautiful woman dressed in gold and riding a white horse.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The fact that geoglyphs can disappear easily, along with their associated rituals and meaning, indicates that they were never intended to be anything more than temporary gestures. But this does not lessen their importance.

Invisible to the naked eye, they are ubiquitous. They inhabit the soil, air, rocks and water and are present within every form of life, from seaweed and coral to dogs and humans. And, as Yong explains in his utterly absorbing and hugely important book we mess with them at our peril.</div><div><br></div><div>Every species has its own colony of microbes, called a &#8216;microbiome&#8217;, and these microbes vary not only between species but also between individuals and within different parts of each individual. What is amazing is that while the number of human cells in the average person is about 30 trillion, the number of microbial ones is higher &#8211; about 39 trillion. At best, Yong informs us, we are only 50 per cent human. Indeed, some scientists even suggest we should think of each species and its microbes as a single unit, dubbed a &#8216;holobiont&#8217;.</div><div><br></div><div>In each human there are microbes that live only in the stomach, the mouth or the armpit and by and large they do so peacefully. So &#8216;bad&#8217; microbes are just microbes out of context. Microbes that sit contentedly in the human gut (where there are more microbes than there are stars in the galaxy) can become deadly if they find their way into the bloodstream. These communities are constantly changing too. The right hand shares just one sixth of its microbes with the left hand. And, of course, we are surrounded by microbes. Every time we eat, we swallow a million microbes in each gram of food; we are continually swapping microbes with other humans, pets and the world at large.</div><div><br></div><div>It&#8217;s a fascinating topic and Yong, a young British science journalist, is an extraordinarily adept guide. Writing with lightness and panache, he has a knack of explaining complex science in terms that are both easy to understand and totally enthralling. Yong is on a mission. Leading us gently by the hand, he takes us into the world of microbes &#8211; a bizarre, alien planet &#8211; in a bid to persuade us to love them as much as he does. By the end, we do.</div><div><br></div><div>For most of human history we had no idea that microbes existed. The first man to see these extraordinarily potent creatures was a Dutch lens-maker called Antony van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670s. Using microscopes of his own design that could magnify up to 270 times, he examined a drop of water from a nearby lake and found it teeming with tiny creatures he called &#8216;animalcules&#8217;. It wasn&#8217;t until nearly two hundred years later that the research of French biologist Louis Pasteur indicated that some microbes caused disease. It was Pasteur&#8217;s &#8216;germ theory&#8217; that gave bacteria the poor image that endures today.</div><div><br></div><div>Yong&#8217;s book is in many ways a plea for microbial tolerance, pointing out that while fewer than one hundred species of bacteria bring disease, many thousands more play a vital role in maintaining our health. The book also acknowledges that our attitude towards bacteria is not a simple one. We tend to see the dangers posed by bacteria, yet at the same time we are sold yoghurts and drinks that supposedly nurture &#8216;friendly&#8217; bacteria. In reality, says Yong, bacteria should not be viewed as either friends or foes, villains or heroes. Instead we should realise we have a symbiotic relationship, that can be mutually beneficial or mutually destructive.</div><div><br></div><div>What then do these millions of organisms do? The answer is pretty much everything. New research is now unravelling the ways in which bacteria aid digestion, regulate our immune systems, eliminate toxins, produce vitamins, affect our behaviour and even combat obesity. &#8216;They actually help us become who we are,&#8217; says Yong. But we are facing a growing problem. Our obsession with hygiene, our overuse of antibiotics and our unhealthy, low-fibre diets are disrupting the bacterial balance and may be responsible for soaring rates of allergies and immune problems, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</div><div><br></div><div>The most recent research actually turns accepted norms upside down. For example, there are studies indicating that the excessive use of household detergents and antibacterial products actually destroys the microbes that normally keep the more dangerous germs at bay. Other studies show that keeping a dog as a pet gives children early exposure to a diverse range of bacteria, which may help protect them against allergies later.</div><div><br></div><div>The readers of Yong&#8217;s book must be prepared for a decidedly unglamorous world. Among the less appealing case studies is one about a fungus that is wiping out entire populations of frogs and that can be halted by a rare microbial bacterium. Another is about squid that carry luminescent bacteria that protect them against predators. However, if you can overcome your distaste for some of the investigations, the reasons for Yong&#8217;s enthusiasm become clear. The microbial world is a place of wonder. Already, in an attempt to stop mosquitoes spreading dengue fever &#8211; a disease that infects 400 million people a year &#8211; mosquitoes are being loaded with a bacterium to block the disease. In the future, our ability to manipulate microbes means we could construct buildings with useful microbes built into their walls to fight off infections. Just imagine a neonatal hospital ward coated in a specially mixed cocktail of microbes so that babies get the best start in life.</div><div><br></div>",

          "content": "<div><b>How to make wise decisions</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Across cultures, wisdom has been considered one of the most revered human qualities. Although the truly wise may seem few and far between, empirical research examining wisdom suggests that it isn&#8217;t an exceptional trait possessed by a small handful of bearded philosophers after all &#8211; in fact, the latest studies suggest that most of us have the ability to make wise decisions, given the right context.</div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;It appears that experiential, situational, and cultural factors are even more powerful in shaping wisdom than previously imagined,&#8217; says Associate Professor Igor Grossmann of the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. &#8216;Recent empirical findings from cognitive, developmental, social, and personality psychology cumulatively suggest that people&#8217;s ability to reason wisely varies dramatically across experiential and situational contexts. Understanding the role of such contextual factors offers unique insights into understanding wisdom in daily life, as well as how it can be enhanced and taught.&#8217;</div><div><br></div><div>It seems that it&#8217;s not so much that some people simply possess wisdom and others lack it, but that our ability to reason wisely depends on a variety of external factors. &#8216;It is impossible to characterize thought processes attributed to wisdom without considering the role of contextual factors,&#8217; explains Grossmann. &#8216;In other words, wisdom is not solely an &#8220;inner quality&#8221; but rather unfolds as a function of situations people happen to be in. Some situations are more likely to promote wisdom than others.&#8217;</div><div><br></div><div>Coming up with a definition of wisdom is challenging, but Grossmann and his colleagues have identified four key characteristics as part of a framework of wise reasoning. One is intellectual humility or recognition of the limits of our own knowledge, and another is appreciation of perspectives wider than the issue at hand. Sensitivity to the possibility of change in social relations is also key, along with compromise or integration of different attitudes and beliefs.</div><div><br></div><div>Grossmann and his colleagues have also found that one of the most reliable ways to support wisdom in our own day-to-day decisions is to look at scenarios from a third-party perspective, as though giving advice to a friend. Research suggests that when adopting a first-person viewpoint we focus on &#8216;the focal features of the environment&#8217; and when we adopt a third-person, &#8216;observer&#8217; viewpoint we reason more broadly and focus more on interpersonal and moral ideals such as justice and impartiality. Looking at problems from this more expansive viewpoint appears to foster cognitive processes related to wise decisions.</div><div><br></div><div>What are we to do, then, when confronted with situations like a disagreement with a spouse or negotiating a contract at work, that require us to take a personal stake? Grossmann argues that even when we aren&#8217;t able to change the situation, we can still evaluate these experiences from different perspectives.</div><div><br></div><div>For example, in one experiment that took place during the peak of a recent economic recession, graduating college seniors were asked to reflect on their job prospects. The students were instructed to imagine their career either &#8216;as if you were a distant observer&#8217; or &#8216;before your own eyes as if you were right there&#8217;. Participants in the group assigned to the &#8216;distant observer&#8217; role displayed more wisdom-related reasoning (intellectual humility and recognition of change) than did participants in the control group.</div><div><br></div><div>In another study, couples in long-term romantic relationships were instructed to visualize an unresolved relationship conflict either through the eyes of an outsider or from their own perspective. Participants then discussed the incident with their partner for 10 minutes, after which they wrote down their thoughts about it. Couples in the &#8216;other&#8217;s eyes&#8217; condition were significantly more likely to rely on wise reasoning &#8211; recognizing others&#8217; perspectives and searching for a compromise &#8211; compared to the couples in the egocentric condition.</div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;Ego-decentering promotes greater focus on others and enables a bigger picture, conceptual view of the experience, affording recognition of intellectual humility and change,&#8217; says Grossmann.</div><div><br></div><div>We might associate wisdom with intelligence or particular personality traits, but research shows only a small positive relationship between wise thinking and crystallized intelligence and the personality traits of openness and agreeableness. &#8216;It is remarkable how much people can vary in their wisdom from one situation to the next, and how much stronger such contextual effects are for understanding the relationship between wise judgment and its social and affective outcomes as compared to the generalized &#8220;traits&#8221;,&#8217; Grossmann explains. &#8216;That is, knowing how wisely a person behaves in a given situation is more informative for understanding their emotions or likelihood to forgive [or] retaliate as compared to knowing whether the person may be wise &#8220;in general&#8221;.&#8217;&#160;</div><div><br></div>",

Shipbuilding in ancient Rome, however, was more of an art relying on estimation, inherited techniques and personal experience. The Romans were not traditionally sailors but mostly land-based people, who learned to build ships from the people that they conquered, namely the Greeks and the Egyptians.</div><div><br></div><div>There are a few surviving written documents that give descriptions and representations of ancient Roman ships, including the sails and rigging. Excavated vessels also provide some clues about ancient shipbuilding techniques. Studies of these have taught us that ancient Roman shipbuilders built the outer hull first, then proceeded with the frame and the rest of the ship. Planks used to build the outer hull were initially sewn together. Starting from the 6th century BCE, they were fixed using a method called mortise and tenon, whereby one plank locked into another without the need for stitching. Then in the first centuries of the current era, Mediterranean shipbuilders shifted to another shipbuilding method, still in use today, which consisted of building the frame first and then proceeding with the hull and the other components of the ship. This method was more systematic and dramatically shortened ship construction times. The ancient Romans built large merchant ships and warships whose size and technology were unequalled until the 16th century CE.</div><div><br></div><div>Warships were built to be lightweight and very speedy. They had to be able to sail near the coast which is why they had no ballast or excess load and were built with a long, narrow hull. They did not sink when damaged and often would lie crippled on the sea&#8217;s surface following naval battles. They had a bronze battering ram, which was used to pierce the timber hulls or break the oars of enemy vessels. Warships used both wind (sails) and human power (oarsmen) and were therefore very fast. Eventually, Rome&#8217;s navy became the largest and most powerful in the Mediterranean, and the Romans had control over what they therefore called Mare Nostrum meaning &#8216;our sea&#8217;.</div><div><br></div><div>There were many kinds of warships. The &#8216;trireme&#8217; was the dominant warship from the 7th to 4th century BCE. It had rowers in the top, middle and lower levels, and approximately 50 rowers in each bank. The rowers at the bottom had the most uncomfortable position as they were under the other rowers and were exposed to the water entering through the oar-holes. It is worth noting that contrary to popular perception, rowers were not slaves but mostly Roman citizens enrolled in the military. The trireme was superseded by larger ships with even more rowers.</div><div><br></div><div>Merchant ships were built to transport lots of cargo over long distances and at a reasonable cost. They had a wider hull, double planking and a solid interior for added stability. Unlike warships, their V-shaped hull was deep underwater, meaning that they could not sail too close to the coast. They usually had two huge side rudders located off the stern and controlled by a small tiller bar connected to a system of cables. They had from one to three masts with large square sails and a small triangular sail at the bow. Just like warships, merchant ships used oarsmen, but coordinating the hundreds of rowers in both types of ship was not an easy task. In order to assist them, music would be played on an instrument, and oars would then keep time with this.</div><div><br></div><div>The cargo on merchant ships included raw materials (e.g. iron bars, copper, marble and granite), and agricultural products (e.g. grain from Egypt&#8217;s Nile valley). During the Empire, Rome was a huge city by ancient standards of about one million inhabitants. Goods from all over the world would come to the city through the port of Pozzuoli situated west of the bay of Naples in Italy and through the gigantic port of Ostia situated at the mouth of the Tiber River. Large merchant ships would approach the destination port and, just like today, be intercepted by a number of towboats that would drag them to the quay.</div><div><br></div><div>The time of travel along the many sailing routes could vary widely. Navigation in ancient Rome did not rely on sophisticated instruments such as compasses but on experience, local knowledge and observation of natural phenomena. In conditions of good visibility, seamen in the Mediterranean often had the mainland or islands in sight, which greatly facilitated navigation. They sailed by noting their position relative to a succession of recognisable landmarks. When weather conditions were not good or where land was no longer visible, Roman mariners estimated directions from the pole star or, with less accuracy, from the Sun at noon. They also estimated directions relative to the wind and swell. Overall, shipping in ancient Roman times resembled shipping today with large vessels regularly crossing the seas and bringing supplies from their Empire.</div><div><br></div>",

As the ice has vanished, it has been giving up the treasures it has preserved in cold storage for the last 6,000 years &#8211; items such as ancient arrows and skis from Viking Age* traders. And those artefacts have provided archaeologists with some surprising insights into how ancient Norwegians made their livings.</div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</div><div>*Viking Age: a period of European history from around 700 CE to around 1050 CE when Scandinavian Vikings migrated throughout Europe by means of trade and warfare</div><div><br></div><div><b>B.</b></div><div>Organic materials like textiles and hides are relatively rare finds at archaeological sites. This is because unless they&#8217;re protected from the microorganisms that cause decay, they tend not to last long. Extreme cold is one reliable way to keep artefacts relatively fresh for a few thousand years, but once thawed out, these materials experience degradation relatively swiftly.</div><div><br></div><div>With climate change shrinking ice cover around the world, glacial archaeologists need to race the clock to find newly revealed artefacts, preserve them, and study them. If something fragile dries and is windblown it might very soon be lost to science, or an arrow might be exposed and then covered again by the next snow and remain well-preserved. The unpredictability means that glacial archaeologists have to be systematic in their approach to fieldwork.</div><div><br></div><div><b>C.&#160;</b></div><div>Over a nine-year period, a team of archaeologists, which included Lars Pil&#248; of Oppland County Council, Norway, and James Barrett of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, surveyed patches of ice in Oppland, an area of south-central Norway that is home to some of the country&#8217;s highest mountains. Reindeer once congregated on these ice patches in the later summer months to escape biting insects, and from the late Stone Age**, hunters followed. In addition, trade routes threaded through the mountain passes of Oppland, linking settlements in Norway to the rest of Europe.</div><div><br></div><div>The slow but steady movement of glaciers tends to destroy anything at their bases, so the team focused on stationary patches of ice, mostly above 1,400 metres. That ice is found amid fields of frost-weathered boulders, fallen rocks, and exposed bedrock that for nine months of the year is buried beneath snow.</div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;Fieldwork is hard work &#8211; hiking with all our equipment, often camping on permafrost &#8211; but very rewarding. You&#8217;re rescuing the archaeology, bringing the melting ice to wider attention, discovering a unique environmental history and really connecting with the natural environment,&#8217; says Barrett.</div><div><br></div><div>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</div><div><br></div><div>**The Stone Age: a period in early history that began about 3.4 million years ago</div><div><br></div><div><b>D.&#160;</b></div><div>At the edges of the contracting ice patches, archaeologists found more than 2,000 artefacts, which formed a material record that ran from 4,000 BCE to the beginnings of the Renaissance in the 14th century. Many of the artefacts are associated with hunting. Hunters would have easily misplaced arrows and they often discarded broken bows rather than take them all the way home. Other items could have been used by hunters traversing the high mountain passes of Oppland: all-purpose items like tools, skis, and horse tack.</div><div><br></div><div><b>E.</b></div><div>Barrett&#8217;s team radiocarbon-dated 153 of the artefacts and compared those dates to the timing of major environmental changes in the region &#8211; such as periods of cooling or warming &#8211; and major social and economic shifts &#8211; such as the growth of farming settlements and the spread of international trade networks leading up to the Viking Age. They found that some periods had produced lots of artefacts, which indicates that people had been pretty active in the mountains during those times. But there were few or no signs of activity during other periods.</div><div><br></div><div><b>F.</b></div><div>What was surprising, according to Barrett, was the timing of these periods. Oppland&#8217;s mountains present daunting terrain and in periods of extreme cold, glaciers could block the higher mountain passes and make travel in the upper reaches of the mountains extremely difficult. Archaeologists assumed people would stick to lower elevations during a time like the Late Antique Little Ice Age, a short period of deeper-than-usual cold from about 536-600 CE. But it turned out that hunters kept regularly venturing into the mountains even when the climate turned cold, based on the amount of stuff they had apparently dropped there.</div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;Remarkably, though, the finds from the ice may have continued through this period, perhaps suggesting that the importance of mountain hunting increased to supplement failing agricultural harvests in times of low temperatures,&#8217; says Barrett. A colder turn in the Scandinavian climate would likely have meant widespread crop failures, so more people would have depended on hunting to make up for those losses.</div><div><br></div><div><b>G.&#160;</b></div><div>Many of the artefacts Barrett&#8217;s team recovered date from the beginning of the Viking Age, the 700s through to the 900s CE. Trade networks connecting Scandinavia with Europe and the Middle East were expanding around this time. Although we usually think of ships when we think of Scandinavian expansion, these recent discoveries show that plenty of goods travelled on overland routes, like the mountain passes of Oppland. And growing Norwegian towns, along with export markets, would have created a booming demand for hides to fight off the cold, as well as antlers to make useful things like combs. Business must have been good for hunters.</div><div><br></div><div><b>H.</b></div><div>Norway&#8217;s mountains are probably still hiding a lot of history &#8211; and prehistory &#8211; in remote ice patches. When Barrett&#8217;s team looked at the dates for their sample of 153 artefacts, they noticed a gap with almost no artefacts from about 3,800 to 2,200 BCE. In fact, archaeological finds from that period are rare all over Norway. The researchers say that could be because many of those artefacts have already disintegrated or are still frozen in the ice. That means archaeologists could be extracting some of those artefacts from retreating ice in years to come.</div><div><br></div>",

Scientists say the discovery could help breed crops that are more resilient to the temperatures expected to result from climate change</div><div><br></div><div><b>A.</b></div><div>An international team of scientists led by the University of Cambridge has discovered that the &#8216;thermometer&#8217; molecule in plants enables them to develop according to seasonal temperature changes. Researchers have revealed that molecules called phytochromes &#8211; used by plants to detect light during the day &#8211; actually change their function in darkness to become cellular temperature gauges that measure the heat of the night.</div><div><br></div><div>The new findings, published in the journal Science, show that phytochromes control genetic switches in response to temperature as well as light to dictate plant development.</div><div><br></div><div><b>B.</b></div><div>At night, these molecules change states, and the pace at which they change is &#8216;directly proportional to temperature&#8217;, say scientists, who compare phytochromes to mercury in a thermometer. The warmer it is, the faster the molecular change &#8211; stimulating plant growth.</div><div><br></div><div><b>C.</b></div><div>Farmers and gardeners have known for hundreds of years how responsive plants are to temperature: warm winters cause many trees and flowers to bud early, something humans have long used to predict weather and harvest times for the coming year. The latest research pinpoints for the first time a molecular mechanism in plants that reacts to temperature &#8211; often triggering the buds of spring we long to see at the end of winter.</div><div><br></div><div><b>D.</b></div><div>With weather and temperatures set to become ever more unpredictable due to climate change, researchers say the discovery that this light-sensing molecule also functions as the internal thermometer in plant cells could help us breed tougher crops. &#8216;It is estimated that agricultural yields will need to double by 2050, but climate change is a major threat to achieving this. Key crops such as wheat and rice are sensitive to high temperatures. Thermal stress reduces crop yields by around 10% for every one degree increase in temperature,&#8217; says lead researcher Dr Philip Wigge from Cambridge&#8217;s Sainsbury Laboratory. &#8216;Discovering the molecules that allow plants to sense temperature has the potential to accelerate the breeding of crops resilient to thermal stress and climate change.&#8217;</div><div><br></div><div><b>E.</b></div><div>In their active state, phytochrome molecules bind themselves to DNA to restrict plant growth. During the day, sunlight activates the molecules, slowing down growth. If a plant finds itself in shade, phytochromes are quickly inactivated &#8211; enabling it to grow faster to find sunlight again. This is how plants compete to escape each other&#8217;s shade. &#8216;Light-driven changes to phytochrome activity occur very fast, in less than a second,&#8217; says Wigge.</div><div><br></div><div>At night, however, it&#8217;s a different story. Instead of a rapid deactivation following sundown, the molecules gradually change from their active to inactive state. This is called &#8216;dark reversion&#8217;. &#8216;Just as mercury rises in a thermometer, the rate at which phytochromes revert to their inactive state during the night is a direct measure of temperature,&#8217; says Wigge.</div><div><br></div><div><b>F.</b></div><div>&#8216;The lower the temperature, the slower the rate at which phytochromes revert to inactivity, so the molecules spend more time in their active, growth-suppressing state. This is why plants are slower to grow in winter. Warm temperatures accelerate dark reversion, so that phytochromes rapidly reach an inactive state and detach themselves from the plant&#8217;s DNA &#8211; allowing genes to be expressed and plant growth to resume.&#8217; Wigge believes phytochrome thermo-sensing evolved at a later stage, and co-opted the biological network already used for light-based growth during the downtime of night.</div><div><br></div><div><b>G.</b></div><div>Some plants mainly use day length as an indicator of the reason. Other species, such as daffodils, have considerable temperature sensitivity, and can flower months in advance during a warm winter. In fact, the discovery of the dual role of phytochromes provides the science behind a well-known rhyme long used to predict the coming season: oak before ash we&#8217;ll have a splash, ash before oak we&#8217;re in for a soak.</div><div>Wigge explains: &#8216;Oak trees rely much more on temperature, likely using phytochromes as thermometers to dictate development, whereas ash trees rely on measuring day length to determine their seasonal timing. A warmer spring, and consequently a higher likeliness of a hot summer, will result in oak leafing before ash. A cold spring will see the opposite. As the British know only too well, a colder summer is likely to be a rain-soaked one.&#8217;</div><div><br></div><div><b>H.</b></div><div>The new findings are the culmination of twelve years of research involving scientists from Germany, Argentina and the US, as well as the Cambridge team. The work was done in a model system, using a mustard plant called Arabidopsis, but Wigge says the phytochrome genes necessary for temperature sensing are found in crop plants as well. &#8216;Recent advances in plant genetics now mean that scientists are able to rapidly identify the genes controlling these processes in crop plants, and even alter their activity using precise molecular &#8220;scalpels&#8221;,&#8217; adds Wigge. &#8216;Cambridge is uniquely well-positioned to do this kind of research as we have outstanding collaborators nearby who work on more applied aspects of plant biology, and can help us transfer this new knowledge into the field.&#8217;</div><div><br></div>",

In the early first millennium BCE, they introduced the qanat method of tunnel construction, which consisted of placing posts over a hill in a straight line, to ensure that the tunnel kept to its route, and then digging vertical shafts down into the ground at regular intervals. Underground, workers removed the earth from between the ends of the shafts, creating a tunnel. The excavated soil was taken up to the surface using the shafts, which also provided ventilation during the work. Once the tunnel was completed, it allowed water to flow from the top of a hillside down towards a canal, which supplied water for human use. Remarkably, some qanats built by the Persians 2,700 years ago are still in use today.</div><div><br></div><div>They later passed on their knowledge to the Romans, who also used the qanat method to construct water-supply tunnels for agriculture. Roma qanat tunnels were constructed with vertical shafts dug at intervals of between 30 and 60 meters. The shafts were equipped with handholds and footholds to help those climbing in and out of them and were covered with a wooden or stone lid. To ensure that the shafts were vertical, Romans hung a plumb line from a rod placed across the top of each shaft and made sure that the weight at the end of it hung in the center of the shaft. Plumb lines were also used to measure the depth of the shaft and to determine the slope of the tunnel. The 5.6-kilometer-long Claudius tunnel, built in 41 CE to drain the Fucine Lake in central Italy, had shafts that were up to 122 meters deep, took 11 years to build and involved approximately 30,000 workers.</div><div><br></div><div>By the 6th century BCE, a second method of tunnel construction appeared called the counter-excavation method, in which the tunnel was constructed from both ends. It was used to cut through high mountains when the qanat method was not a practical alternative. This method required greater planning and advanced knowledge of surveying, mathematics and geometry as both ends of a tunnel had to meet correctly at the center of the mountain. Adjustments to the direction of the tunnel also had to be made whenever builders encountered geological problems or when it deviated from its set path. They constantly checked the tunnel&#8217;s advancing direction, for example, by looking back at the light that penetrated through the tunnel mouth, and made corrections whenever necessary. Large deviations could happen, and they could result in one end of the tunnel not being usable. An inscription written on the side of a 428-meter tunnel, built by the Romans as part of the Saldae aqueduct system in modern-day Algeria, describes how the two teams of builders missed each other in the mountain and how the later construction of a lateral link between both corridors corrected the initial error.</div><div><br></div><div>The Romans dug tunnels for their roads using the counter-excavation method, whenever they encountered obstacles such as hills or mountains that were too high for roads to pass over. An example is the 37-meter-long, 6-meter-high, Furlo Pass Tunnel built in Italy in 69-79 CE. Remarkably, a modern road still uses this tunnel today. Tunnels were also built for mineral extraction. Miners would locate a mineral vein and then pursue it with shafts and tunnels underground. Traces of such tunnels used to mine gold can still be found at the Dolaucothi mines in Wales. When the sole purpose of a tunnel was mineral extraction, construction required less planning, as the tunnel route was determined by the mineral vein.</div><div><br></div><div>Roman tunnel projects were carefully planned and carried out. The length of time it took to construct a tunnel depended on the method being used and the type of rock being excavated. The qanat construction method was usually faster than the counter-excavation method as it was more straightforward. This was because the mountain could be excavated not only from the tunnel mouths but also from shafts. The type of rock could also influence construction times. When the rock was hard, the Romans employed a technique called fire quenching which consisted of heating the rock with fire, and then suddenly cooling it with cold water so that it would crack. Progress through hard rock could be very slow, and it was not uncommon for tunnels to take years, if not decades, to be built. Construction marks left on a Roman tunnel in Bologna show that the rate of advance through solid rock was 30 centimeters per day. In contrast, the rate of advance of the Claudius tunnel can be calculated at 1.4 meters per day. Most tunnels had inscriptions showing the names of patrons who ordered construction and sometimes the name of the architect. For example, the 1.4-kilometer &#199;evlik tunnel in Turkey, built to divert the floodwater threatening the harbor of the ancient city of Seleuceia Pieria, had inscriptions on the entrance, still visible today, that also indicate that the tunnel was started in 69 CE and was completed in 81 CE.</div><div><br></div>",

          "content": "<div><b>Changes in reading habits</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><i>What are the implications of the way we read today?</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>Look around on your next plane trip. The iPad is the new pacifier for babies and toddlers. Younger school-aged children read stories on smartphones; older kids don&#8217;t read at all, but hunch over video games. Parents and other passengers read on tablets or skim a flotilla of email and news feeds. Unbeknown to most of us, an invisible, game-changing transformation links everyone in this picture: the neuronal circuit that underlies the brain&#8217;s ability to read is subtly, rapidly changing and this has implications for everyone from the pre-reading toddler to the expert adult.</div><div><br></div><div>As work in neurosciences indicates, the acquisition of literacy necessitated a new circuit in our species&#8217; brain more than 6,000 years ago. That circuit evolved from a very simple mechanism for decoding basic information, like the number of goats in one&#8217;s herd, to the present, highly elaborated reading brain. My research depicts how the present reading brain enables the development of some of our most important intellectual and affective processes: internalized knowledge, analogical reasoning, and inference; perspective-taking and empathy; critical analysis and the generation of insight. Research surfacing in many parts of the world now cautions that each of these essential &#8216;deep reading&#8217; processes may be under threat as we move into digital-based modes of reading.</div><div><br></div><div>This is not a simple, binary issue of print versus digital reading and technological innovations. As MIT scholar Sherry Turkle has written, we do not err as a society when we innovate but when we ignore what we disrupt or diminish while innovating. In this hinge moment between print and digital cultures, society needs to confront what is diminishing in the expert reading circuit, what our children and older students are not developing, and what we can do about it.</div><div><br></div><div>We know from research that the reading circuit is not given to human beings through a genetic blueprint like vision or language; it needs an environment to develop. Further, it will adapt to that environment&#8217;s requirements &#8211; from different writing systems to the characteristics of whatever medium is used. If the dominant medium advantages processes that are fast, multi-task oriented and well-suited for large volumes of information, like the current digital medium, so will the reading circuit. As UCLA psychologist Patricia Greenfield writes, the result is that less attention and time will be allocated to slower, time-demanding deep reading processes.</div><div><br></div><div>Increasing reports from educators and from researchers in psychology and the humanities bear this out. English literature scholar and teacher Mark Edmundson describes how many college students actively avoid the classic literature of the 19th and 20th centuries in favour of something simpler as they no longer have the patience to read longer, denser, more difficult texts. We should be less concerned with students&#8217; &#8216;cognitive impatience&#8217;, however, than by what may underlie it: the potential inability of large numbers of students to read with a level of critical analysis sufficient to comprehend the complexity of thought and argument found in more demanding texts.</div><div><br></div><div>Multiple studies show that digital screen use may be causing a variety of troubling downstream effects on reading comprehension in older high school and college students. In Stavanger, Norway, psychologist Anne Mangen and colleagues studied how high school students comprehend the same material in different mediums. Mangen&#8217;s group asked subjects questions about a short story whose plot had universal student appeal; half of the students read the story on a tablet, the other half in paperback. Results indicated that students who read on print were superior in their comprehension to screen-reading peers, particularly in their ability to sequence detail and reconstruct the plot in chronological order.</div><div><br></div><div>Ziming Liu from San Jose State University has conducted a series of studies which indicate that the &#8216;new norm&#8217; in reading is skimming, involving word-spotting and browsing through the text. Many readers now use a pattern when reading in which they sample the first line and then word-spot through the rest of the text. When the reading brain skims like this, it reduces time allocated to deep reading processes. In other words, we don&#8217;t have time to grasp complexity, to understand another&#8217;s feelings, to perceive beauty, and to create thoughts of the reader&#8217;s own.</div><div><br></div><div>The possibility that critical analysis, empathy and other deep reading processes could become the unintended &#8216;collateral damage&#8217; of our digital culture is not a straightforward binary issue about print versus digital reading. It is about how we all have begun to read o various mediums and how that changes not only what we read, but also the purposes for which we read. Nor is it only about the young. The subtle atrophy of critical analysis and empathy affects us all equally. It affects our ability to navigate a constant bombardment of information. It incentivizes a retreat to the most familiar stores of unchecked information, which require and receive no analysis, leaving us susceptible to false information and irrational ideas.</div><div><br></div><div>There&#8217;s an old rule in neuroscience that does not alter with age: use it or lose it. It is a very hopeful principle when applied to critical thought in the reading brain because it implies choice. The story of the changing reading brain is hardly finished. We possess both the science and the technology to identify and redress the changes in how we read before they become entrenched. If we work to understand exactly what we will lose, alongside the extraordinary new capacities that the digital world has brought us, there is as much reason for excitement as caution.</div><div><br></div>",

          "content": "<div><b>Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>A.</b></div><div>Artificial intelligence (AI) can already predict the future. Police forces are using it to map when and where crime is likely to occur. Doctors can use it to predict when a patient is most likely to have a heart attack or stroke. Researchers are even trying to give AI imagination so it can plan for unexpected consequences.</div><div><br></div><div>Many decisions in our lives require a good forecast, and AI is almost always better at forecasting than we are. Yet for all these technological advances, we still seem to deeply lack confidence in AI predictions. Recent cases show that people don&#8217;t like relying on AI and prefer to trust human experts, even if these experts are wrong.</div><div><br></div><div>If we want AI to really benefit people, we need to find a way to get people to trust it. To do that, we need to understand why people are so reluctant to trust AI in the first place.</div><div><br></div><div><b>B.</b></div><div>Take the case of Watson for Oncology, one of technology giant IBM&#8217;s supercomputer programs. Their attempt to promote this program to cancer doctors was a PR disaster. The AI promised to deliver top-quality recommendations on the treatment of 12 cancers that accounted for 80% of the world&#8217;s cases. But when doctors first interacted with Watson, they found themselves in a rather difficult situation. On the one hand, if Watson provided guidance about a treatment that coincided with their own opinions, physicians did not see much point in Watson&#8217;s recommendations. The supercomputer was simply telling them what they already knew, and these recommendations did not change the actual treatment.</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, if Watson generated a recommendation that contradicted the experts&#8217; opinion, doctors would typically conclude that Watson wasn&#8217;t competent. And the machine wouldn&#8217;t be able to explain why its treatment was plausible because its machine-learning algorithms were simply too complex to be fully understood by humans. Consequently, this has caused even more suspicion and disbelief, leading many doctors to ignore the seemingly outlandish AI recommendations and stick to their own expertise.</div><div><br></div><div><b>C.</b></div><div>This is just one example of people&#8217;s lack of confidence in AI and their reluctance to accept what AI has to offer. Trust in other people is often based on our understanding of how others think and having experience of their reliability. This helps create a psychological feeling of safety. AI, on the other hand, is still fairly new and unfamiliar to most people. Even if it can be technically explained (and that&#8217;s not always the case), AI&#8217;s decision-making process is usually too difficult for most people to comprehend. And interacting with something we don&#8217;t understand can cause anxiety and give us a sense that we&#8217;re losing control.</div><div><br></div><div>Many people are also simply not familiar with many instances of AI actually working, because it often happens in the background. Instead, they are acutely aware of instances where AI goes wrong. Embarrassing AI failures receive a disproportionate amount of media attention, emphasising the message that we cannot rely on technology. Machine learning is not foolproof, in part because the humans who design it aren&#8217;t.</div><div><br></div><div><b>D.</b> Feelings about AI run deep. In a recent experiment, people from a range of backgrounds were given various sci-fi films about AI to watch and then asked questions about automation in everyday life. It was found that, regardless of whether the film they watched depicted AI in a positive or negative light, simply watching a cinematic vision of our technological future polarised the participants&#8217; attitudes. Optimists became more extreme in their enthusiasm for AI and sceptics became even more guarded.</div><div><br></div><div>This suggests people use relevant evidence about AI in a biased manner to support their existing attitudes, a deep-rooted human tendency known as &#8220;confirmation bias&#8221;. As AI is represented more and more in media and entertainment, it could lead to a society split between those who benefit from AI and those who reject it. More pertinently, refusing to accept the advantages offered by AI could place a large group of people at a serious disadvantage.</div><div><br></div><div><b>E.</b></div><div>Fortunately, we already have some ideas about how to improve trust in AI. Simply having previous experience with AI can significantly improve people&#8217;s opinions about the technology, as was found in the study mentioned above. Evidence also suggests the more you use other technologies such as the internet, the more you trust them.</div><div><br></div><div>Another solution may be to reveal more about the algorithms which AI uses and the purposes they serve. Several high-profile social media companies and online marketplaces already release transparency reports about government requests and surveillance disclosures. A similar practice for AI could help people have a better understanding of the way algorithmic decisions are made.</div><div><br></div><div><b>F.</b></div><div>Research suggests that allowing people some control over AI decision-making could also improve trust and enable AI to learn from human experience. For example, one study showed that when people were allowed the freedom to slightly modify an algorithm, they felt more satisfied with its decisions, more likely to believe it was superior and more likely to use it in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>We don&#8217;t need to understand the intricate inner workings of AI systems, but if people are given a degree of responsibility for how they are implemented, they will be more willing to accept AI into their lives.</div><div><br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Bricks - The Versatile Building Material</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Bricks are one of the oldest known building materials dating back to 7000 BCE. The oldest found were sun-dried mud bricks in southern Turkey and these would have been standard in those days. Although sun-dried mud bricks worked reasonably well, especially in moderate climates, fired bricks were found to be more resistant to harsher weather conditions and so fired bricks are much more reliable for use in permanent buildings. Fired brick are also useful in hotter climates, as they can absorb any heat generated throughout the day and then release it at night.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The Romans also distinguished between the bricks they used that were dried by the sun and air and the bricks that were fired in a kiln. The Romans were real brick connoisseurs. They preferred to make their bricks in the spring and hold on to their bricks for two years, before they were used or sold. They only used clay that was whitish or red for their bricks. The Romans passed on their skills around their sphere of influence and were especially successful at using their mobile kilns to introduce kiln-fired bricks to the whole of the Roman Empire.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>During the twelfth century, bricks were introduced to northern Germany from northern Italy. This created the &#8216;brick Gothic period,&#8217; which was a reduced style of Gothic architecture previously very common in northern Europe. The buildings around this time were mainly built from fired red clay bricks. The brick Gothic period can be categorised by the lack of figural architectural sculptures that had previously been carved in stone, as the Gothic figures were impossible to create out of bulky bricks at that time.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Bricks suffered a setback during the Renaissance and Baroque periods, with exposed brick walls becoming unpopular and brickwork being generally covered by plaster. Only during the mid eighteenth century did visible brick walls again regain some popularity.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Bricks today are more commonly used in the construction of buildings than any other material, except wood. Brick architecture is dominant within its field and a great industry has developed and invested in the manufacture of many different types of bricks of all shapes and colours. With modern machinery, earth moving equipment, powerful electric motors and modern tunnel kilns, making bricks has become much more productive and efficient. Bricks can be made from a variety of materials, the most common being clay, but they can also be made of calcium silicate and concrete.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Good quality bricks have major advantages over stone as they are reliable, weather resistant and can tolerate acids, pollution and fire. They are also much cheaper than cut stonework. Bricks can be made to any specification in colour, size and shape, which makes them easier to build with than stone. On the other hand, there are some bricks that are more porous and therefore more susceptible to damage from dampness when exposed to water. For best results in any construction work, the correct brick must be chosen in accordance with the job specifications.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Today, bricks are mainly manufactured in factories, usually employing one of three principal methods - the soft mud process, the stiff mud process and the dry clay process. In the past, bricks were largely manufactured by hand, and there are still artisanal companies that specialise in this product. The process involves putting the clay, water and additives into a large pit, where it is all mixed together by a tempering wheel, often still moved by horse power. Once the mixture is of the correct consistency, the clay is removed and pressed into moulds by hand. To prevent the brick from sticking to the mould, the brick is coated in either sand or water, though coating a brick with sand gives an overall better finish to it. Once shaped, the bricks are laid outside to dry by air and sun for three to four days. If these bricks left outside for the drying process are exposed to a shower, the water can leave indentations on the brick, which, although not affecting the strength of the brick, is considered very undesirable. After drying, the bricks are then transferred to the kiln for firing and this creates the finished product. Bricks are now more generally made by manufacturing processes using machinery. This is a large-scale effort and produces bricks that have been fired in patent kilns.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Today&#8217;s bricks are also specially designed to be efficient at insulation. If their composition is correct and their laying accurate, a good brick wall around a house can save the occupants a significant amount of money. This is primarily achieved today through cavity wall insulation. Insulating bricks are built in two separate leaves, as they are called in the trade. The gap between the inner and outer leaves of brickwork depends on the type of insulation used, but there should be enough space for a gap of twenty millimetres between the insulating material in the cavity and the two leaves on either side. The air in these gaps is an efficient insulator by itself. Cavity walls have also replaced solid walls, because they are more resistant to rain penetration. Because two leaves are necessary, a strong brick manufacturing industry is essential, so that enough good quality insulating bricks are plentifully available.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Rise of Agri tourism</b><div><br></div><div>In advanced industrialised countries, small farmers have been challenged by changing economic and social conditions, such as increased global competition, falling commodity prices, and capital- and technology-intensive agricultural production. In addition, there has been added public pressure to make expensive changes in farming methods, due to public environmental concerns about industrialised agricultural production in combination with political pressures to reduce agricultural subsidies. These changing economic and social conditions have disproportionately impacted smaller farms in Europe and the US.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Agritourism is becoming an increasingly popular way for rural property owners to earn additional income from agricultural properties. In addition to more traditional farm tours and seasonal activities, such as hay rides, corn mazes and u-pick fruits, farm owners are devising new ways to bring people to their door by offering more entertainment-oriented activities. Some farmers are offering their barns as venues for weddings, parties, dances and other special events. Others are opening their homes to visitors for vacations, so guests can experience life on a working farm by helping out with routine farm chores, such as feeding or herding the livestock, milking the animals, making cheese, collecting eggs, picking vegetables and preparing farm fresh meals. Agritourism works in combination with a growing public desire to engage in rural experiences and outdoor recreational activities. By combining agriculture and tourism, agritourism offers these rural experiences to urban residents and economic diversification to farmers.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Part of the attraction of agritourism is the nostalgia it creates for a simpler time and its authenticity. Tourists are being sold, not only on beautiful sceneries and visual aesthetics, but also experiences that are meant to open up a new world for these customers who are tired of the hustle and bustle of city life. Authenticity has been an abiding theme in tourism studies and it may have a special meaning in this combination of agriculture and tourism. For one thing, the image of the family farm remains imbued with deep authenticity, the surviving representation of an old world ideal. To partake in agritourism is therefore likely to convey the sense of having a deeply authentic experience. Critics have claimed that this desire to reconnect with the life world of one&#8217;s ancestors may conflict with the nature of modern agriculture and whether the tourist will want to face its true realities. It seems therefore that often the most distinctive innovative effort involves the reinvention of tradition and rural tourism products. Examples are the recreation of home- produced products long since replaced by manufactured commodities and the provision of hands-on-experiences in crafts often recreated for tourists. As a result, some critics argue that the tourists who are running to the countryside are over-crowding and ruining the pristine beauty that they so desperately want to experience.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Agritourism can benefit the life and economy of local communities, as well as the farms themselves. Agritourism firstly means that some farms can continue in business and employ workers. Employment underscores the genuine importance of agritourism farms to local economies, as rural communities are usually areas that both have high unemployment and few alternatives for the unemployed to find work. Secondly, a significant number of agritourists come from areas reasonably local to the visited farms. This means that tourist spending on agritourism often stays in the region, helping to generate taxable revenues and more disposable incomes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s agricultural census, taken every five years, found that last year approximately 23,000 farms took part in agritourism. These farms each earned $24,300 from agritourism, compared to five years ago, when farms engaged in this brought in only $7,200 per farm. The trend is clearly growing and the money generated will stimulate local economies. Thirdly, agritourism benefits the local community in terms of education. Many farms offer tours for elementary school-age children, who can learn where their food is coming from and how it is produced.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Farms choosing to develop agritourism have had reasonable government support. Over the last 20 years, European Union countries have spent 2 billion euros to subsidise agritourism development in rural farming areas that cannot compete in a global market with declining commodity prices. This, in turn, helps governments by keeping farmers on land, protecting picturesque rural landscapes that attract tourists, and supporting the production of regional agricultural products. As well as finance, local and national governments should create in the areas under their jurisdiction favourable environments for the development of agritourism, by changing regulatory and tax constraints, so that more farms are encouraged to enter the industry.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It is clear that there are strong economic and social benefits that agritourism can provide farmers, customers and the local areas where the farms are situated. Agritourism contributes to and enhances the quality of life in communities by expanding recreational opportunities, differentiating rural economies, and promoting the retention of agricultural lands. Working agricultural landscapes reflect the efforts of generations of farm families and often provide a defining sense of culture, heritage, and rural character. Agritourism provides educational opportunities for school children and adults to learn about this agrarian heritage, the production of food, and resource stewardship. Finally, many agritourism operations provide consumers with direct access to fresh farm goods. Agritourism is an industry with an enormous potential for growth. With it, farming could become more efficient and sustainable, rural areas could become more beautiful and farmers could become better off and more significant employers and contributors to economies.</div>",

It is usually spread by just dirty fingers and in most cases is confined to the gut. As the virus travels down the intestine, it induces the body to produce antibodies against it, which will protect the person against future attacks. In about one per cent of cases, the virus floods into the bloodstream and infects the nerve cells in the spinal cord that drive the muscles. This causes the characteristic paralysis, which can affect one or more limbs and/or the muscles of respiration, in which case artificial ventilation, for example with the iron lung, may be needed to keep the patient breathing and alive. The iron lung, which was officially known as a negative pressure ventilator, was invented hundreds of years ago, but was further developed in the 1930&#8217;s to help with the world polio outbreaks. At one point, the need for iron lungs was so high that they were used with a patient within an hour of their manufacture.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B<br></b></div><div>Polio originally caused sporadic clusters of paralysis, especially in children. For some reason, this pattern changed during the late nineteenth century into explosive epidemics, which swept through many countries each summer. The first major outbreak, on the East Coast of the USA in the summer of 1916, caused 25,000 cases of paralysis and 6,000 deaths. Draconian public health measures were powerless to prevent the spread of the disease, resulting in widespread panic across America. Each year, panic resurfaced as the polio season approached, with the wealthy leaving towns and cities in droves.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b><br></div><div>This fear of polio was deliberately fuelled and exploited by the March of Dimes, an American fund- raising organisation set up by President Franklin D Roosevelt, himself a polio survivor. The March of Dimes raised vast sums, and funded both practical support for polio victims and their families, and the research programmes that ultimately resulted in effective polio vaccines.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D<br></b></div><div>Polio can be prevented but not cured. Treatments proposed for patients with acute polio have included barbaric measures, such as branding the child&#8217;s back with a red-hot poker and &#8216;brain washout therapy&#8217;. Less dramatic were massive doses of vitamins C and chemically modified cobra venom. None of these had any impact on paralysis or survival, and some were positively dangerous. The iron lung could rescue patients from suffocation if their respiratory muscles were paralysed, but the iron lung itself carried considerable risks. Until chest infections could be properly treated, seventy per cent of patients put inside the iron lung died there.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b><br></div><div>Two rival strategies were used to develop vaccines to protect against polio. Jonas Salk (1914&#8211;1998) favoured an &#8216;inactivated polio vaccine&#8217; (IPV), in which wild polioviruses are &#8216;killed&#8217; with formalin, so that they can no longer replicate and spread into the spinal cord. IPV is injected into a muscle and causes protective antibodies to appear in the bloodstream. The &#8216;oral polio vaccine&#8217; (OPV) developed by Albert Sabin (1906&#8211;1993) relies on the fact that polioviruses forced to grow under unfavourable conditions in the laboratory will undergo mutation into forms that can no longer invade the spinal cord. The OPV virus is still &#8216;alive&#8217; and able to replicate, but cannot enter the spinal cord and cause paralysis. OPV is taken by mouth and, like a wild poliovirus, induces immunity against itself in the gut wall as it travels through the intestine. It therefore provides a different type of immunity protection when compared with the Salk vaccine.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b><br></div><div>Salk&#8217;s IPV was the first polio vaccine to be tested on a large scale, in massive clinical trials in 1954 involving 1.8 million American children. Following the sensational declaration that his vaccine &#8216;works and is safe&#8217;, Salk became a national and international hero, and mass vaccination of children with his IPV began immediately. Vaccination continued despite a tragic outbreak of paralytic (and sometimes fatal) polio due to contamination of the Salk vaccine with wild poliovirus, which was the result of carelessness in the vaccine production plant. Numbers of paralytic cases and deaths from polio fell dramatically in the USA over the next few years, and Salk&#8217;s vaccine was taken up across the world. Sabin&#8217;s OPV, being cheaper, more effective and easier to give, later superseded the Salk vaccine. Given correctly, both vaccines protect against polio and are overwhelmingly safe. There is an exceedingly low risk (one in 500,000 vaccinations) of Sabin&#8217;s OPV reverting to a paralysing variant, a drawback that Sabin always refused to acknowledge.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b><br></div><div>Polio vaccine not only protects individuals, but, if given intensively and on a massive scale, can prevent the virus from spreading and so stamp it out. In 1988, various organisations set out to clear the planet of polio through a worldwide vaccination campaign. The hope was that polio would follow the example of smallpox, which was exterminated by intensive global vaccination during the late 1970&#8217;s. Now, after 26 years, polio is tantalisingly close to being eradicated, with just 200 paralytic cases worldwide last year, as compared with over 300,000 in 1988. Tragically, though, endemic polio continues to cling on in three areas, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Northern Nigeria, largely because of anti-western ideology that is backed up by intimidation, death threats and the murder of many vaccinators and their supporters. Usually refugees, but also other travellers, have reintroduced polio to other countries, for example Syria, Lebanon and various African states, which had been previously cleared of polio. Unfortunately, it is now very unlikely that polio will be eradicated within the next two to three years and it seems that the final extermination of the virus will depend as much on diplomacy as on medicine and science.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Draconian &#8211; severe or harsh.</div><div>In droves &#8211; in large numbers.</div></div>",

Not much can be gleaned from observing recumbent persons and questionnaires are no use, because people remember little of their experience during sleep. The breakthrough came in the 1950&#8217;s with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of brain electrical activity, when it was confirmed that sleep is anything but dormant.<br></div><div><br></div><div>We need sleep for biological restoration. It promotes cell growth, regeneration and memory consolidation. By shutting down most of the body&#8217;s machinery, resources can be focused on repairing damage and development. When people are deprived of sleep for any reason, there is deterioration in performance, particularly on tasks requiring concentration, and eventually, behaviour becomes shambolic. The individual becomes progressively incoherent and irritable and, after a few days, may experience delusions and hallucinations. The disruptive effects of sleep deprivation have even been successfully used as a basis of persuasion in interrogation.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A vital part of sleep is dreaming, which happens most intensively during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. We typically spend more than two hours each night dreaming, though this is often spread over four or five separate periods. Infants spend up to 50 per cent of their sleep time in REM sleep, which is understandable when one realises that REM sleep is the time used for brain development, as well as learning, thinking, and organising information. If people are woken when REM sleep commences, depriving them specifically of dream-sleep, the proportion of REM sleep increases once they fall asleep again to make up what was lost. This suggests that REM sleep is an essential aspect of sleep.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Sleep and sleep-related problems play a role in a large number of human disorders and affect almost every field of medicine. For example, problems like a stroke tend to occur more frequently during the night and early morning, due to changes in hormones, heart rate, and other characteristics associated with sleep. Sleep also affects some kinds of epilepsy in complex ways. REM sleep seems to help prevent seizures that begin in one part of the brain from spreading to other brain regions, while deep sleep may promote the spread of these seizures. Sleep deprivation can also trigger seizures in people with some types of epilepsy.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The neurons that control sleep interact strongly with the immune system. As anyone who has had the flu knows, infectious diseases tend to make people feel sleepy. This probably happens because cytokines, chemicals produced while fighting an infection, are powerful sleep-inducing substances. Sleep helps the body conserve energy that the body&#8217;s immune system needs to mount an attack.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Sleeping problems occur in almost all people with mental disorders, including those with depression and schizophrenia. People with depression, for example, often awaken in the early hours of the morning and find themselves unable to get back to sleep. The amount of sleep a person gets also strongly influences the symptoms of mental disorders. Sleep deprivation is an effective therapy for people with certain types of depression, while it can actually cause depression in other people. Extreme sleep deprivation can lead to a seemingly psychotic state of paranoia and hallucinations in otherwise healthy people, and disrupted sleep can trigger episodes of mania in people with manic depression.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Sleeping problems are common in many other disorders as well, including Alzheimer&#8217;s disease, stroke, cancer, and head injury. These sleeping problems may arise from changes in the brain regions and neurotransmitters that control sleep, or from the drugs used to control symptoms of other disorders. In patients who are hospitalised or who receive round-the-clock care, treatment schedules or hospital routines also may disrupt sleep. The old joke about a patient being awakened by a nurse so he could take a sleeping pill contains a grain of truth. Once sleeping problems develop, they can add to a person&#8217;s impairment and cause confusion, frustration, or depression. Patients who are unable to sleep also notice pain more and may increase their requests for pain medication. Better management of sleeping problems in people who have a variety of disorders could improve the health of these patients and their quality of life.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Insomnia is a widespread affliction. It is linked with conditions such as depression and chronic pain, but occurs also in otherwise healthy people. It is often due to temporary life circumstances, like trouble at work or anticipation of an exciting event, however, some people just have difficulty sleeping regardless of circumstances. What is interesting is that complaints of sleeplessness are often exaggerated, because people remember more easily the times they are awake during the night than the times they are asleep. When insomniacs are observed in a sleep lab, their EEG records often suggest that their sleep pattern is fairly normal, even though in the morning they maintain they hardly slept a wink. Various devices for monitoring one&#8217;s own sleep patterns are now marketed, for example mobile phone apps connected with forehead electrodes.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The fact that a third of our life is spent in sleep would, in itself, be sufficient justification for studying it scientifically. The discovery that it is not just a passive state, but a highly active process of profound biological and psychological importance, has led to great efforts in recent decades to further our understanding of it. Despite that, we are far from unravelling all of sleep&#8217;s mysteries.<br></div>",

Stars remain fixed in the pattern of their constellations, and are regular in their motion through the sky from one night to the next, and from one month to the next. A planet follows a fairly slow but expected path. By comparison, a comet is a totally different kind of event: it will appear unexpectedly and at any place in the sky, it will change position from one night to the next relative to the background of stars, and its path will be along a separate direction and path across the sky from the planets and stars. During the few weeks or months that it is observable, it will first steadily increase in brightness from one night to the next, may change its shape &#8211; growing bigger, longer or extra tails &#8211; and then wane to invisibility, never to be seen again. Throughout history, comets have always signified evil, war and death, and they were supposed to leave chaos and calamity in their wake. Indeed, plenty of past comets have been blamed by the astrologers of their day for bringing or marking misfortune.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There have been many spectacular comets throughout history; on average we are visited by what is termed a &#8216;great comet&#8217; about three times a century. This appellation is saved for those comets that reach exceptional brightness. The most famous of all comets is Halley&#8217;s comet; not that it is the most spectacular, but study of its orbit by the English astronomer, Edmond Halley, was fundamental to pinning down the real nature of comets. During the 17th century, Halley was using Newton&#8217;s new mathematics of calculus to try to characterise the orbits of twenty-four comets from sightings recorded over the previous four centuries. He realised that the orbital path of the bright comet recently seen in 1682 was very similar to that followed by two other comets &#8211; one observed in 1531 and one in 1607. All moved in a retrograde direction (i.e. opposite to the revolution of the planets round the Sun), following an elliptical orbit that had a similar orientation to the plane of the planets&#8217; motion. The great comet of 1456 was also known to have travelled in a retrograde direction. Halley&#8217;s inspiration was to realise that these were four apparitions of the same comet, following a set path around the Sun, but which only became apparent to observers on Earth when its orbit returned the comet to the inner Solar System, after an interval of about 76 years. Although he did not live to see the success of his prediction of the comet&#8217;s return in 1758, when the comet was spotted on schedule, it was given his name. Subsequently, at least 23 previous appearances of Halley&#8217;s comet have been identified from historical records, the first known being from a Chinese text dating from 240BC.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The nucleus is the sole solid component of a comet, and the only part that is always present. It resembles a dark-coloured iceberg; it is a frozen chunk of ice ranging between 5 to 20 km in size, and with a somewhat irregular shape. The ice is not just water ice, but also contains the ices of frozen ammonia, carbon dioxide, methane and carbon monoxide. The ices are blackened, as they contain small fragments of dust embedded within them, and the whole nucleus is of a low density, suggesting it to be a partially porous body. When travelling along the outer reaches of its orbit, far from the Sun, the nucleus remains frozen and dormant. As soon as its path brings the icy block into the inner Solar system, it begins to warm up and its surface becomes active. The solid ice turns directly into gas, in a process known as &#8216;sublimation,&#8217; and is liberated from the surface. The process is particularly apparent on the sunward flank of the nucleus, where the gases escape as jets, particularly through any fissures that open up in the structure. These jets also push out the particles of solid dust that are embedded in the ice.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The closer an orbit brings a nucleus to the Sun, the warmer it becomes, and the more spectacular tails are generated with them, sometimes being visible during the day. There are two types of comet tails: dust and gas ion. A dust tail contains small, solid particles that are about the same size as those found in cigarette smoke. This tail forms because sunlight pushes on these small particles, gently shoving them away from the comet&#8217;s nucleus. Because the pressure from sunlight is relatively weak, the dust particles end up forming a diffuse curved tail in the direction of the comet&#8217;s orbit. A gas ion tail forms when ultraviolet sunlight rips one or more electrons from gas atoms in the coma, making them into ions. The solar wind then carries these ions straight outward away from the Sun. As a comet heads away from the Sun, its tails dissipate, and the matter contained in its nucleus freezes into a rock-like material.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Constellation &#8211; a recognised pattern of bodies in the sky.</div><div>Elliptical &#8211; oval-shaped.</div><div>Sublimation - the change of a substance from solid to gas without an intermediate liquid stage.</div></div>",

Until the 1990&#8217;s, most of this recovery has occurred from conventional wells that were drilled down to rock formations, from which hydrocarbons could be pumped to the surface. The discovery of hydraulic fracking in the late 1940&#8217;s has long allowed companies to extract gas and oil from shale, but the perfection of these two techniques over the past few decades has allowed the process to become cost effective. There are numerous shale plays in the United States from which shale gas can be extracted, and firms are busy drilling wells in many areas of the country.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B&#160;</b></div><div><span>Shale gas is natural methane in rock formations deep underground that, before fracking, was not feasible to extract. Its removal today depends on hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Hydraulic fracturing is the use of pressure to force liquids containing proppants (often sand) into rock strata, so that hydrocarbons are available for extraction. Current technology uses water, sand, and miscellaneous fluids, all of which must be imported to the well site. A wellbore is drilled, and then the fracturing fluid is forced through holes in the casing into the plays. High pressures are used to create fissures where the proppants are deposited to hold fissures open, so that hydrocarbons can be released. Hydraulic fracturing occurs in a number of stages and the fracturing fluid is forced into a small portion of the wellbore at each stage. After the hydraulic fracturing is completed, some of the fracturing fluid comes back up the well. Because the flowback and wastewater from a well can be toxic, it must be disposed of in a manner that does not create any health, safety, or environmental problems. The underground areas from which the gas is extracted may be left with cavities, which in turn can sometimes cause ground subsidence.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph C&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>The development of American shale gas deposits has been accompanied by notable benefits and a significant impact on the American economy. Next year, it is estimated that the development of America&#8217;s shale gas resources will employ 869,000 people. The shale gas industry will have capital expenditures of $48 billion and pay more than $28 billion in federal and state taxes this year. Due to shale gas, the US is using less coal and the country&#8217;s electricity costs have been lowered by about ten per cent. Shale gas has also contributed to a decrease in imports of foreign natural gas.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph D&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>Yet not everything is positive. The development of shale gas resources is associated with its toxic pollutants and environmental problems. It needs to be mentioned that the American federal and state governments were not prepared for the problems that accompany shale gas development. A lack of sufficient regulatory oversight in the US when the industry began allowed some unfortunate situations and instances of damage that could have been prevented.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph E&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>Sites where wells are drilled for extracting shale gas often cover about two hectares and involve increased traffic, noise, light, dangerous equipment, and toxic chemicals. The activities and conditions at a site therefore create a potential for contamination and environmental degradation. The major risk involves damage from the toxic chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The fracking fluid is approximately 99.5 per cent water and sand and 0.5 per cent additives used to enhance hydrocarbon recovery. An average of 5000 gallons of chemical additives may be used to frack a well and some of them are toxic. Since different chemicals and different amounts are used at each well, the toxicities may vary.</span><br></span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F&#160;&#160;</b></div><div><span>Under US federal law, the chemicals used at a well are exempted from full reporting requirements. Under most state laws, the supplier or the service company of a fracturing operation must disclose information, unless the chemicals are claimed as a trade secret. Recently, it was estimated that in approximately two-thirds of the cases the complete chemical compositions were not reported. Chemical secrecy is a problem, because persons working at wells and persons who come into contact with chemicals used at a well do not have sufficient information to know whether they need medical attention. Without timely information of the chemicals involved in a spill or release, first responders to emergencies, health professionals, and property owners may lack key information for deciding what actions they should take.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph G</b></span></span></div><div><span>Issues are also being raised about the need for better management practices to reduce the risks that accompany shale gas development. Hundreds of best management practices have been identified to employ during energy development and extraction, but most of these are currently voluntary. In the absence of mandatory management practices covering all of the stages of shale gas development, there are not sufficient assurances that people and the environment are adequately protected against health and safety problems. By adopting more mandatory management practices, the industry may be able to reduce the risks and shale gas development would be beneficial overall.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph H&#160;</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>The American experiences can be helpful in discerning whether other countries might proceed with shale gas development. The activities connected with developing shale gas can be assessed to learn about the risks, dangers, and problems that need to be addressed. Then, existing laws and regulations can be evaluated to determine their probable success in addressing the risks. Additional regulations can be developed if they are needed and firms can be required to adopt best management practices. Governments can require disclosure of dangerous materials and establish funding mechanisms to pay for regulatory oversight and for collecting monies to be used to remedy future damages caused by fracking.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div>Shale play &#8211; An underground formation of a type of rock containing natural gas.</div><div>Proppant &#8211; A solid material used in fracking to keep holes open during the fracking process.</div></span></div>",

          "content": "<b>The development of the London underground railway</b><div><b><br></b><div><div>In the first half of the 1800s, London&#8217;s population grew at an astonishing rate, and the central area became increasingly congested. In addition, the expansion of the overground railway network resulted in more and more passengers arriving in the capital. However, in 1846, a Royal Commission decided that the railways should not be allowed to enter the City, the capital&#8217;s historic and business centre. The result was that the overground railway stations formed a ring around the City. The area within consisted of poorly built, overcrowded slums and the streets were full of horse-drawn traffic. Crossing the City became a nightmare. It could take an hour and a half to travel 8 km by horse-drawn carriage or bus. Numerous schemes were proposed to resolve these problems, but few succeeded.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Amongst the most vocal advocates for a solution to London&#8217;s traffic problems was Charles Pearson, who worked as a solicitor for the City of London. He saw both social and economic advantages in building an underground railway that would link the overground railway stations together and clear London slums at the same time. His idea was to relocate the poor workers who lived in the inner-city slums to newly constructed suburbs, and to provide cheap rail travel for them to get to work. Pearson&#8217;s ideas gained support amongst some businessmen and in 1851 he submitted a plan to Parliament. It was rejected, but coincided with a proposal from another group for an underground connecting line, which Parliament passed.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The two groups merged and established the Metropolitan Railway Company in August 1854. The company&#8217;s plan was to construct an underground railway line from the Great Western Railway&#8217;s (GWR) station at Paddington to the edge of the City at Farringdon Street &#8211; a distance of almost 5 km. The organisation had difficulty in raising the funding for such a radical and expensive scheme, not least because of the critical articles printed by the press. Objectors argued that the tunnels would collapse under the weight of traffic overhead, buildings would be shaken and passengers would be poisoned by the emissions from the train engines. However, Pearson and his partners persisted.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The GWR, aware that the new line would finally enable them to run trains into the heart of the City, invested almost &#163;250,000 in the scheme. Eventually, over a five-year period, &#163;1m was raised. The chosen route ran beneath existing main roads to minimise the expense of demolishing buildings. Originally scheduled to be completed in 21 months, the construction of the underground line took three years. It was built just below street level using a technique known as &#8216;cut and cover&#8217;. A trench about ten metres wide and six metres deep was dug, and the sides temporarily held up with timber beams. Brick walls were then constructed, and finally a brick arch was added to create a tunnel. A two-metre-deep layer of soil was laid on top of the tunnel and the road above rebuilt.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div>The Metropolitan line, which opened on 10 January 1863, was the world&#8217;s first underground railway. On its first day, almost 40,000 passengers were carried between Paddington and Farringdon, the journey taking about 18 minutes. By the end of the Metropolitan&#8217;s first year of operation, 9.5 million journeys had been made.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Even as the Metropolitan began operation, the first extensions to the line were being authorised; these were built over the next five years, reaching Moorgate in the east of London and Hammersmith in the West. The original plan was to pull the trains with steam locomotives, using firebricks in the boilers to provide steam, but these engines were never introduced. Instead, the line used specially designed locomotives that were fitted with water tanks in which steam could be condensed. However, smoke and fumes remained a problem, even though ventilation shafts were added to the tunnels.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Despite the extension of the underground railway, by the 1880s, congestion on London&#8217;s streets had become worse. The problem was partly that the existing underground lines formed a circuit around the centre of London and extended to the suburbs, but did not cross the capital&#8217;s centre. The &#8216;cut and cover&#8217; method of construction was not an option in this part of the capital. The only alternative was to tunnel deep underground.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Although the technology to create these tunnels existed, steam locomotives could not be used in such a confined space. It wasn&#8217;t until the development of a reliable electric motor, and a means of transferring power from the generator to a moving train, that the world&#8217;s first deep-level electric railway, the City &amp; South London, became possible. The line opened in 1890, and ran from the City to Stockwell, south of the River Thames. The trains were made up of three carriages and driven by electric engines. The carriages were narrow and had tiny windows just below the roof because it was thought that passengers would not want to look out at the tunnel walls. The line was not without its problems, mainly caused by an unreliable power supply. Although the City &amp; South London Railway was a great technical achievement, it did not make a profit. Then, in 1900, the Central London Railway, known as the &#8216;Tuppenny Tube&#8217;, began operation using new electric locomotives. It was very popular and soon afterwards new railways and extensions were added to the growing tube network. By 1907, the heart of today&#8217;s Underground system was in place.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Stadiums: Past, Present and Future</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>A.</b>&#160;Stadiums are among the oldest forms of urban architecture: vast stadiums where the public could watch sporting events were at the centre of western city life as far back as the ancient Greek and Roman Empires, well before the construction of the great mediaeval cathedrals and the grand 19th- and 20th-century railway stations which dominated urban skylines in later eras.</div><div><br></div><div>Today, however, stadiums are regarded with growing scepticism. Construction costs can soar above &#163;1 billion, and stadiums finished for major events such as the Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup have notably fallen into disuse and disrepair.<br></div><div><br></div><div>But this need not be the case. History shows that stadiums can drive urban development and adapt to the culture of every age. Even today, architects and planners are finding new ways to adapt the mono-functional sports arenas which became emblematic of modernisation during the 20th century.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B.</b>&#160;The amphitheatre* of Arles in southwest France, with a capacity of 25,000 spectators, is perhaps the best example of just how versatile stadiums can be. Built by the Romans in 90 AD, it became a fortress with four towers after the fifth century, and was then transformed into a village containing more than 200 houses. With the growing interest in conservation during the 19th century, it was converted back into an arena for the staging of bullfights, thereby returning the structure to its original use as a venue for public spectacles.</div><div><br></div><div>Another example is the imposing arena of Verona in northern Italy, with space for 30,000 spectators, which was built 60 years before the Arles amphitheatre and 40 years before Rome&#8217;s famous Colosseum. It has endured the centuries and is currently considered one of the world&#8217;s prime sites for opera, thanks to its outstanding acoustics.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C.</b>&#160;The area in the centre of the Italian town of Lucca, known as the Piazza dell&#8217; Anfiteatro, is yet another impressive example of an amphitheatre becoming absorbed into the fabric of the city. The site evolved in a similar way to Arles and was progressively filled with buildings from the Middle Ages until the 19th century, variously used as houses, a salt depot and a prison. But rather than reverting to an arena, it became a market square, designed by Romanticist architect Lorenzo Nottolini. Today, the ruins of the amphitheatre remain embedded in the various shops and residences surrounding the public square.</div><div><br></div><div><b>D.</b>&#160;There are many similarities between modern stadiums and the ancient amphitheatres intended for games. But some of the flexibility was lost at the beginning of the 20th century, as stadiums were developed using new products such as steel and reinforced concrete, and made use of bright lights for night-time matches.</div><div><br></div><div><b>E.</b>&#160;But many of today&#8217;s most innovative architects see scope for the stadium to help improve the city. Among the current strategies, two seem to be having particular success: the stadium as an urban hub, and as a power plant.</div><div><br></div><div>There&#8217;s a growing trend for stadiums to be equipped with public spaces and services that serve a function beyond sport, such as hotels, retail outlets, conference centres, restaurants and bars, children&#8217;s playgrounds and green space. Creating mixed-use developments such as this reinforces compactness and multi-functionality, making more efficient use of land and helping to regenerate urban spaces.<br></div><div><br></div><div>This opens the space up to families and a wider cross-section of society, instead of catering only to sportspeople and supporters. There have been many examples of this in the UK: the mixed-use facilities at Wembley and Old Trafford have become a blueprint for many other stadiums in the world.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F.</b>&#160;The phenomenon of stadium as power stations has arisen from the idea that energy problems can be overcome by integrating interconnected buildings by means of a smart grid, which is an electricity supply network that uses digital communications technology to detect and react to local changes in usage, without significant energy losses. Stadiums are ideal for these purposes, because their canopies have a large surface area for fitting photovoltaic panels and rise high enough (more than 40 metres) to make use of micro wind turbines.</div><div><br></div><div>Freiburg Mage Solar Stadium in Germany is the first of a new wave of stadiums as power plants, which also includes the Amsterdam Arena and the Kaohsiung Stadium. The latter, inaugurated in 2009, has 8,844 photovoltaic panels producing up to 1.14 GWh of electricity annually. This reduces the annual output of carbon dioxide by 660 tons and supplies up to 80 percent of the surrounding area when the stadium is not in use. This is proof that a stadium can serve its city, and have a decidedly positive impact in terms of reduction of CO2 emissions.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>G.</b>&#160;Sporting arenas have always been central to the life and culture of cities. In every era, the stadium has acquired new value and uses: from military fortress to residential village, public space to theatre and most recently a field for experimentation in advanced engineering. The stadium of today now brings together multiple functions, thus helping cities to create a sustainable future.</div>",

          "content": "<b>To Catch a King</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Anna Keay reviews Charles Spencer&#8217;s book about the hunt for King Charles II during the English Civil War of the seventeenth century.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Charles Spencer&#8217;s latest book, To Catch a King, tells us the story of the hunt for King Charles II in the six weeks after his resounding defeat at the Battle of Worcester in September 1651. And what a story it is. After his father was executed by the Parliamentarians in 1649, the young Charles II sacrificed one of the very principles his father had died for and did a deal with Scots, thereby accepting Presbyterianism* as the national religion in return for being crowned King of Scots. His arrival in Edinburgh prompted the English Parliamentary army to invade Scotland in a pre-emptive strike. This was followed by a Scottish invasion of England. The two sides finally faced one another at Worcester in the west of England in 1651. After being comprehensively defeated on the meadows outside the city by the Parliamentarian army, the 21-year-old king found himself the subject of a national manhunt, with a huge sum offered for his capture, through a series of heart &#8211; pounding close escapes, to evade the Parliamentarians before seeking refuge in France. For the next nine years, the penniless and defeated Charles wandered around Europe with only a small group of loyal supporters.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Years later, after his restoration as king, the 50-year-old Charles II requested a meeting with the writer and diarist Samuel Pepys. His intention when asking Pepys to commit his story to paper was to ensure that this most extraordinary episode was never forgotten. Over two three-hour sittings, the king related to him in great detail his personal recollections of the six weeks he had spent as a fugitive. As the king and secretary settled down (a scene that is surely a gift for a future scriptwriter), Charles commenced his story: &#8216;After the battle was so absolutely lost as to be beyond hope of recovery, I began to think of the best way of saving myself.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div>One of the joys of Spencer&#8217;s book, a result not least of its use of Charles II&#8217;s own narrative as well as those of his supporters, is just how close the reader gets to the action. The day-by-day retelling of the fugitives&#8217; doings provides delicious details: the cutting of the king&#8217;s long hair with agricultural shears, the use of walnut leaves to dye his pale skin, and the day Charles spent lying on a branch of the great oak tree in Boscobel Wood as the Parliamentary soldiers scoured the forest floor below. Spencer draws out both the humour &#8211; such as the preposterous refusal of Charles&#8217;s friend Henry Wilmot to adopt disguise on the grounds that it was beneath his dignity &#8211; and the emotional tension when the secret of the king&#8217;s presence was cautiously revealed to his supporters.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Charles&#8217;s adventures after losing the Battle of Worcester hide the uncomfortable truth that whilst almost everyone in England had been appalled by the execution of his father, they had not welcomed the arrival of his son with the Scots army, but had instead firmly bolted their doors. This was partly because he rode at the head of what looked like a foreign invasion force and partly because, after almost a decade of civil war, people were desperate to avoid it beginning again. This makes it all the more interesting that Charles II himself loved the story so much ever after. As well as retelling it to anyone who would listen, causing eye-rolling among courtiers, he set in train a series of initiatives to memorialise it. There was to be a new order of chivalry, the Knights of the Royal Oak. A series of enormous oil paintings depicting the episode were produced, including a two-metre-wide canvas of Boscobel Wood and a set of six similarly enormous paintings of the king on the run. In 1660, Charles II commissioned the artist John Michael Wright to paint a flying squadron of cherubs* carrying an oak tree to the heavens on the ceiling of his bedchamber. It is hard to imagine many other kings marking the lowest point in their life so enthusiastically, or indeed pulling off such an escape in the first place.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Charles Spencer is the perfect person to pass the story on to a new generation. His pacey, readable prose steers deftly clear of modern idioms and elegantly brings to life the details of the great tale. He has even-handed sympathy for both the fugitive king and the fierce republican regime that hunted him, and he succeeds in his desire to explore far more of the background of the story than previous books on the subject have done. Indeed, the opening third of the book is about how Charles II found himself at Worcester in the first place, which for some will be reason alone to read To Catch a King.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The tantalizing question left, in the end, is that of what it all meant. Would Charles II have been a different king had these six weeks never happened? The days and nights spent in hiding must have affected him in some way. Did the need to assume disguises, to survive on wit and charm alone, to use trickery and subterfuge to escape from tight corners help form him? This is the one area where the book doesn&#8217;t quite hit the mark. Instead its depiction of Charles II in his final years as an ineffective, pleasure-loving monarch doesn&#8217;t do justice to the man (neither is it accurate), or to the complexity of his character. But this one niggle aside, To Catch a King is an excellent read, and those who come to it knowing little of the famous tale will find they have a treat in store.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Dead Sea Scrolls</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>In late 1946 or early 1947, three Bedouin teenagers were tending their goats and sheep near the ancient settlement of Qumran, located on the northwest shore of the Dead Sea in what is now known as the West Bank. One of these young shepherds tossed a rock into an opening on the side of a cliff and was surprised to hear a shattering sound. He and his companions later entered the cave and stumbled across a collection of large clay jars, seven of which contained scrolls with writing on them. The teenagers took the seven scrolls to a nearby town where they were sold for a small sum to a local antiquities dealer. Word of the find spread, and Bedouins and archaeologists eventually unearthed tens of thousands of additional scroll fragments from 10 nearby caves; together they make up between 800 and 900 manuscripts. It soon became clear that this was one of the greatest archaeological discoveries ever made.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The origin of the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were written around 2,000 years ago between 150 BCE and 70 CE, is still the subject of scholarly debate even today. According to the prevailing theory, they are the work of a population that inhabited the area until Roman troops destroyed the settlement around 70 CE. The area was known as Judea at that time, and the people are thought to have belonged to a group called the Essenes, a devout Jewish sect.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The majority of the texts on the Dead Sea Scrolls are in Hebrew, with some fragments written in an ancient version of its alphabet thought to have fallen out of use in the fifth century BCE. But there are other languages as well. Some scrolls are in Aramaic, the language spoken by many inhabitants of the region from the sixth century BCE to the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In addition, several texts feature translations of the Hebrew Bible into Greek.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The Dead Sea Scrolls include fragments from every book of the Old Testament of the Bible except for the Book of Esther. The only entire book of the Hebrew Bible preserved among the manuscripts from Qumran is Isaiah; this copy, dated to the first century BCE, is considered the earliest biblical manuscript still in existence. Along with biblical texts, the scrolls include documents about sectarian regulations and religious writings that do not appear in the Old Testament.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The writing on the Dead Sea Scrolls is mostly in black or occasionally red ink, and the scrolls themselves are nearly all made of either parchment (animal skin) or an early form of paper called &#8216;papyrus&#8217;. The only exception is the scroll numbered 3Q15, which was created out of a combination of copper and tin. Known as the Copper Scroll, this curious document features letters chiselled onto metal &#8211; perhaps, as some have theorized, to better withstand the passage of time. One of the most intriguing manuscripts from Qumran, this is a sort of ancient treasure map that lists dozens of gold and silver caches. Using an unconventional vocabulary and odd spelling, it describes 64 underground hiding places that supposedly contain riches buried for safekeeping. None of these hoards have been recovered, possibly because the Romans pillaged Judea during the first century CE. According to various hypotheses, the treasure belonged to local people, or was rescued from the Second Temple before its destruction or never existed to begin with.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls have been on interesting journeys. In 1948, a Syrian Orthodox archbishop known as Mar Samuel acquired four of the original seven scrolls from a Jerusalem shoemaker and part-time antiquity dealer, paying less than $100 for them. He then travelled to the United States and unsuccessfully offered them to a number of universities, including Yale. Finally, in 1954, he placed an advertisement in the business newspaper The Wall Street Journal &#8211; under the category &#8216;Miscellaneous Items for Sale&#8217; &#8211; that read: &#8216;Biblical Manuscripts dating back to at least 200 B.C. are for sale. This would be an ideal gift to an educational or religious institution by an individual or group.&#8217; Fortunately, Israeli archaeologist and statesman Yigael Yadin negotiated their purchase and brought the scrolls back to Jerusalem, where they remain to this day.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In 2017, researchers from the University of Haifa restored and deciphered one of the last untranslated scrolls. The university&#8217;s Eshbal Ratson and Jonathan Ben-Dov spent one year reassembling the 60 fragments that make up the scroll. Deciphered from a band of coded text on parchment, the find provides insight into the community of people who wrote it and the 364-day calendar they would have used. The scroll names celebrations that indicate shifts in seasons and details two yearly religious events known from another Dead Sea Scroll. Only one more known scroll remains untranslated.<br></div>",

Now two separate teams in Brazil and China have done it all over again in less than three years. And they have done it better in some ways, as the re-domesticated tomatoes are more nutritious than the ones we eat at present.<br></div><div><br></div><div>This approach relies on the revolutionary CRISPR genome editing technique, in which changes are deliberately made to the DNA of a living cell, allowing genetic material to be added, removed or altered. The technique could not only improve existing crops, but could also be used to turn thousands of wild plants into useful and appealing foods. In fact, a third team in the US has already begun to do this with a relative of the tomato called the groundcherry.<br></div><div><br></div><div>This fast-track domestication could help make the world&#8217;s food supply healthier and far more resistant to diseases, such as the rust fungus devastating wheat crops.<br></div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;This could transform what we eat,&#8217; says Jorg Kudla at the University of Munster in Germany, a member of the Brazilian team. &#8216;There are 50,000 edible plants in the world, but 90 percent of our energy comes from just 15 crops.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;We can now mimic the known domestication course of major crops like rice, maize, sorghum or others,&#8217; says Caixia Gao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. &#8216;Then we might try to domesticate plants that have never been domesticated.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>Wild tomatoes, which are native to the Andes region in South America, produce pea-sized fruits. Over many generations, peoples such as the Aztecs and Incas transformed the plant by selecting and breeding plants with mutations* in their genetic structure, which resulted in desirable traits such as larger fruit.<br></div><div><br></div><div>But every time a single plant with a mutation is taken from a larger population for breeding, much genetic diversity is lost. And sometimes the desirable mutations come with less desirable traits. For instance, the tomato strains grown for supermarkets have lost much of their flavour.<br></div><div><br></div><div>By comparing the genomes of modern plants to those of their wild relatives, biologists have been working out what genetic changes occurred as plants were domesticated. The teams in Brazil and China have now used this knowledge to reintroduce these changes from scratch while maintaining or even enhancing the desirable traits of wild strains.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>Kudla&#8217;s team made six changes altogether. For instance, they tripled the size of fruit by editing a gene called FRUIT WEIGHT, and increased the number of tomatoes per truss by editing another called MULTIFLORA.<br></div><div><br></div><div>While the historical domestication of tomatoes reduced levels of the red pigment lycopene &#8211; thought to have potential health benefits &#8211; the team in Brazil managed to boost it instead. The wild tomato has twice as much lycopene as cultivated ones; the newly domesticated one has five times as much.<br></div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;They are quite tasty,&#8217; says Kudla. &#8216;A little bit strong. And very aromatic.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div>The team in China re-domesticated several strains of wild tomatoes with desirable traits lost in domesticated tomatoes. In this way they managed to create a strain resistant to a common disease called bacterial spot race, which can devastate yields. They also created another strain that is more salt tolerant &#8211; and has higher levels of vitamin C.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>Meanwhile, Joyce Van Eck at the Boyce Thompson Institute in New York state decided to use the same approach to domesticate the groundcherry or goldenberry (Physalis pruinosa) for the first time. This fruit looks similar to the closely related Cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana).<br></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Groundcherries are already sold to a limited extent in the US but they are hard to produce because the plant has a sprawling growth habit and the small fruits fall off the branches when ripe. Van Eck&#8217;s team has edited the plants to increase fruit size, make their growth more compact and to stop fruits dropping. &#8216;There&#8217;s potential for this to be a commercial crop,&#8217; says Van Eck. But she adds that taking the work further would be expensive because of the need to pay for a licence for the CRISPR technology and get regulatory approval.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>This approach could boost the use of many obscure plants, says Jonathan Jones of the Sainsbury Lab in the UK. But it will be hard for new foods to grow so popular with farmers and consumers that they become new staple crops, he thinks.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The three teams already have their eye on other plants that could be &#8216;catapulted into the mainstream&#8217;, including foxtail, oat-grass and cowpea. By choosing wild plants that are drought or heat tolerant, says Gao, we could create crops that will thrive even as the planet warms.<br></div><div><br></div><div>But Kudla didn&#8217;t want to reveal which species were in his team&#8217;s sights, because CRISPR has made the process so easy. &#8216;Any one with the right skills could go to their lab and do this.&#8217;<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Insight or evolution?</b><div><i><br></i></div><div><i>Two scientists consider the origins of discoveries and other innovative behavior</i><br></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>Scientific discovery is popularly believed to result from the sheer genius of such intellectual stars as naturalist Charles Darwin and theoretical physicist Albert Einstein. Our view of such unique contributions to science often disregards the person&#8217;s prior experience and the efforts of their lesser-known predecessors. Conventional wisdom also places great weight on insight in promoting breakthrough scientific achievements, as if ideas spontaneously pop into someone&#8217;s head &#8211; fully formed and functional.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There may be some limited truth to this view. However, we believe that it largely misrepresents the real nature of scientific discovery, as well as that of creativity and innovation in many other realms of human endeavor.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Setting aside such greats as Darwin and Einstein &#8211; whose monumental contributions are duly celebrated &#8211; we suggest that innovation is more a process of trial and error, where two steps forward may sometimes come with one step back, as well as one or more steps to the right or left. This evolutionary view of human innovation undermines the notion of creative genius and recognizes the cumulative nature of scientific progress.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Consider one unheralded scientist: John Nicholson, a mathematical physicist working in the 1910s who postulated the existence of &#8216;proto-elements&#8217; in outer space. By combining different numbers of weights of these proto-elements&#8217; atoms, Nicholson could recover the weights of all the elements in the then-known periodic table. These successes are all the more noteworthy given the fact that Nicholson was wrong about the presence of proto-elements: they do not actually exist. Yet, amid his often fanciful theories and wild speculations, Nicholson also proposed a novel theory about the structure of atoms. Niels Bohr, the Nobel prize-winning father of modern atomic theory, jumped off from this interesting idea to conceive his now-famous model of the atom.<br></div><div><br></div><div>What are we to make of this story? One might simply conclude that science is a collective and cumulative enterprise. That may be true, but there may be a deeper insight to be gleaned. We propose that science is constantly evolving, much as species of animals do. In biological systems, organisms may display new characteristics that result from random genetic mutations. In the same way, random, arbitrary or accidental mutations of ideas may help pave the way for advances in science. If mutations prove beneficial, then the animal or the scientific theory will continue to thrive and perhaps reproduce.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Support for this evolutionary view of behavioral innovation comes from many domains. Consider one example of an influential innovation in US horseracing. The so-called &#8216;acey-deucy&#8217; stirrup placement, in which the rider&#8217;s foot in his left stirrup is placed as much as 25 centimeters lower than the right, is believed to confer important speed advantages when turning on oval tracks. It was developed by a relatively unknown jockey named Jackie Westrope. Had Westrope conducted methodical investigations or examined extensive film records in a shrewd plan to outrun his rivals? Had he foreseen the speed advantage that would be conferred by riding acey-deucy? No. He suffered a leg injury, which left him unable to fully bend his left knee. His modification just happened to coincide with enhanced left-hand turning performance. This led to the rapid and widespread adoption of riding acey-deucy by many riders, a racing style which continues in today&#8217;s thoroughbred racing.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Plenty of other stories show that fresh advances can arise from error, misadventure, and also pure serendipity &#8211; a happy accident. For example, in the early 1970s, two employees of the company 3M each had a problem: Spencer Silver had a product &#8211; a glue which was only slightly sticky &#8211; and no use for it, while his colleague Art Fry was trying to figure out how to affix temporary bookmarks in his hymn book without damaging its pages. The solution to both these problems was the invention of the brilliantly simple yet phenomenally successful Post-It note. Such examples give lie to the claim that ingenious, designing minds are responsible for human creativity and invention. Far more banal and mechanical forces may be at work; forces that are fundamentally connected to the laws of science.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The notions of insight, creativity and genius are often invoked, but they remain vague and of doubtful scientific utility, especially when one considers the diverse and enduring contributions of individuals such as Plato, Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Galileo, Newton, Kepler, Curie, Pasteur and Edison. These notions merely label rather than explain the evolution of human innovations. We need another approach, and there is a promising candidate.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The Law of Effect was advanced by psychologist Edward Thorndike in 1898, some 40 years after Charles Darwin published his groundbreaking work on biological evolution, On the Origin of Species. This simple law holds that organisms tend to repeat successful behaviors and to refrain from performing unsuccessful ones. Just like Darwin&#8217;s Law of Natural Selection, the Law of Effect involves an entirely mechanical process of variation and selection, without any end objective in sight.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Of course, the origin of human innovation demands much further study. In particular, the provenance of the raw material on which the Law of Effect operates is not as clearly known as that of the genetic mutations on which the Law of Natural Selection operates. The generation of novel ideas and behaviors may not be entirely random, but constrained by prior successes and failures &#8211; of the current individual (such as Bohr) or of predecessors (such as Nicholson).<br></div><div><br></div><div>The time seems right for abandoning the naive notions of intelligent design and genius, and for scientifically exploring the true origins of creative behavior.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The thylacine</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>The extinct thylacine, also known as the Tasmanian tiger, was a marsupial* that bore a superficial resemblance to a dog. Its most distinguishing feature was the 13&#8211;19 dark brown stripes over its back, beginning at the rear of the body and extending onto the tail. The thylacine&#8217;s average nose- to-tail length for adult males was 162.6 cm, compared to 153.7 cm for females.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i><u>* marsupial: a mammal, such as a kangaroo, whose young are born incompletely developed and are typically carried and suckled in a pouch on the mother&#8217;s belly</u></i><br></div><div><br></div><div>The thylacine appeared to occupy most types of terrain except dense rainforest, with open eucalyptus forest thought to be its prime habitat. In terms of feeding, it was exclusively carnivorous, and its stomach was muscular with an ability to distend so that it could eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce. The thylacine was not a fast runner and probably caught its prey by exhausting it during a long pursuit. During long-distance chases, thylacines were likely to have relied more on scent than any other sense. They emerged to hunt during the evening, night and early morning and tended to retreat to the hills and forest for shelter during the day. Despite the common name &#8216;tiger&#8217;, the thylacine had a shy, nervous temperament. Although mainly nocturnal, it was sighted moving during the day and some individuals were even recorded basking in the sun.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The thylacine had an extended breeding season from winter to spring, with indications that some breeding took place throughout the year. The thylacine, like all marsupials, was tiny and hairless when born. Newborns crawled into the pouch on the belly of their mother, and attached themselves to one of the four teats, remaining there for up to three months. When old enough to leave the pouch, the young stayed in a lair such as a deep rocky cave, well-hidden nest or hollow log, whilst the mother hunted.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Approximately 4,000 years ago, the thylacine was widespread throughout New Guinea and most of mainland Australia, as well as the island of Tasmania. The most recent, well-dated occurrence of a thylacine on the mainland is a carbon-dated fossil from Murray Cave in Western Australia, which is around 3,100 years old. Its extinction coincided closely with the arrival of wild dogs called dingoes in Australia and a similar predator in New Guinea. Dingoes never reached Tasmania, and most scientists see this as the main reason for the thylacine&#8217;s survival there.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The dramatic decline of the thylacine in Tasmania, which began in the 1830s and continued for a century, is generally attributed to the relentless efforts of sheep farmers and bounty hunters** with shotguns. While this determined campaign undoubtedly played a large part, it is likely that various other factors also contributed to the decline and eventual extinction of the species. These include competition with wild dogs introduced by European settlers, loss of habitat along with the disappearance of prey species, and a distemper-like disease which may also have affected the thylacine.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i><u>** bounty hunters: people who are paid a reward for killing a wild animal</u></i><br></div><div><br></div><div>There was only one successful attempt to breed a thylacine in captivity, at Melbourne Zoo in 1899. This was despite the large numbers that went through some zoos, particularly London Zoo and Tasmania&#8217;s Hobart Zoo. The famous naturalist John Gould foresaw the thylacine&#8217;s demise when he published his Mammals of Australia between 1848 and 1863, writing, &#8216;The numbers of this singular animal will speedily diminish, extermination will have its full sway, and it will then, like the wolf of England and Scotland, be recorded as an animal of the past.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div>However, there seems to have been little public pressure to preserve the thylacine, nor was much concern expressed by scientists at the decline of this species in the decades that followed. A notable exception was T.T. Flynn, Professor of Biology at the University of Tasmania. In 1914, he was sufficiently concerned about the scarcity of the thylacine to suggest that some should be captured and placed on a small island. But it was not until 1929, with the species on the very edge of extinction, that Tasmania&#8217;s Animals and Birds Protection Board passed a motion protecting thylacines only for the month of December, which was thought to be their prime breeding season. The last known wild thylacine to be killed was shot by a farmer in the north-east of Tasmania in 1930, leaving just captive specimens. Official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government was introduced in July 1936, 59 days before the last known individual died in Hobart Zoo on 7th September, 1936.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There have been numerous expeditions and searches for the thylacine over the years, none of which has produced definitive evidence that thylacines still exist. The species was declared extinct by the Tasmanian government in 1986.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Palm oil</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>A</b></div><div>Palm oil is an edible oil derived from the fruit of the African oil palm tree, and is currently the most consumed vegetable oil in the world. It&#8217;s almost certainly in the soap we wash with in the morning, the sandwich we have for lunch, and the biscuits we snack on during the day. Why is palm oil so attractive for manufacturers? Primarily because its unique properties &#8211; such as remaining solid at room temperature &#8211; make it an ideal ingredient for long-term preservation, allowing many packaged foods on supermarket shelves to have &#8216;best before&#8217; dates of months, even years, into the future.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>Many farmers have seized the opportunity to maximise the planting of oil palm trees. Between 1990 and 2012, the global land area devoted to growing oil palm trees grew from 6 to 17 million hectares, now accounting for around ten percent of total cropland in the entire world. From a mere two million tonnes of palm oil being produced annually globally 50 years ago, there are now around 60 million tonnes produced every single year, a figure looking likely to double or even triple by the middle of the century.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>However, there are multiple reasons why conservationists cite the rapid spread of oil palm plantations as a major concern. There are countless news stories of deforestation, habitat destruction and dwindling species populations, all as a direct result of land clearing to establish oil palm tree monoculture on an industrial scale, particularly in Malaysia and Indonesia. Endangered species &#8211; most famously the Sumatran orangutan, but also rhinos, elephants, tigers, and numerous other fauna &#8211; have suffered from the unstoppable spread of oil palm plantations.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>&#8216;Palm oil is surely one of the greatest threats to global biodiversity,&#8217; declares Dr Farnon Ellwood of the University of the West of England, Bristol. &#8216;Palm oil is replacing rainforest, and rainforest is where all the species are. That&#8217;s a problem.&#8217; This has led to some radical questions among environmentalists, such as whether consumers should try to boycott palm oil entirely.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Meanwhile Bhavani Shankar, Professor at London&#8217;s School of Oriental and African Studies, argues, &#8216;It&#8217;s easy to say that palm oil is the enemy and we should be against it. It makes for a more dramatic story, and it&#8217;s very intuitive. But given the complexity of the argument, I think a much more nuanced story is closer to the truth.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>One response to the boycott movement has been the argument for the vital role palm oil plays in lifting many millions of people in the developing world out of poverty. Is it desirable to have palm oil boycotted, replaced, eliminated from the global supply chain, given how many low-income people in developing countries depend on it for their livelihoods? How best to strike a utilitarian balance between these competing factors has become a serious bone of contention.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>Even the deforestation argument isn&#8217;t as straightforward as it seems. Oil palm plantations produce at least four and potentially up to ten times more oil per hectare than soybean, rapeseed, sunflower or other competing oils. That immensely high yield &#8211; which is predominantly what makes it so profitable &#8211; is potentially also an ecological benefit. If ten times more palm oil can be produced from a patch of land than any competing oil, then ten times more land would need to be cleared in order to produce the same volume of oil from that competitor.<br></div><div><br></div><div>As for the question of carbon emissions, the issue really depends on what oil palm trees are replacing. Crops vary in the degree to which they sequester carbon &#8211; in other words, the amount of carbon they capture from the atmosphere and store within the plant. The more carbon a plant sequesters, the more it reduces the effect of climate change. As Shankar explains: &#8216;[Palm oil production] actually sequesters more carbon in some ways than other alternatives. [...] Of course, if you&#8217;re cutting down virgin forest it&#8217;s terrible &#8211; that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening in Indonesia and Malaysia, it&#8217;s been allowed to get out of hand. But if it&#8217;s replacing rice, for example, it might actually sequester more carbon.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>G</b></div><div>The industry is now regulated by a group called the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), consisting of palm growers, retailers, product manufacturers, and other interested parties. Over the past decade or so, an agreement has gradually been reached regarding standards that producers of palm oil have to meet in order for their product to be regarded as officially &#8216;sustainable&#8217;. The RSPO insists upon no virgin forest clearing, transparency and regular assessment of carbon stocks, among other criteria. Only once these requirements are fully satisfied is the oil allowed to be sold as certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO). Recent figures show that the RSPO now certifies around 12 million tonnes of palm oil annually, equivalent to roughly 21 percent of the world&#8217;s total palm oil production.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>H</b></div><div>There is even hope that oil palm plantations might not need to be such sterile monocultures, or &#8216;green deserts&#8217;, as Ellwood describes them. New research at Ellwood&#8217;s lab hints at one plant which might make all the difference. The bird&#8217;s nest fern (Asplenium nidus) grows on trees in an epiphytic fashion (meaning it&#8217;s dependent on the tree only for support, not for nutrients), and is native to many tropical regions, where as a keystone species it performs a vital ecological role. Ellwood believes that reintroducing the bird&#8217;s nest fern into oil palm plantations could potentially allow these areas to recover their biodiversity, providing a home for all manner of species, from fungi and bacteria, to invertebrates such as insects, amphibians, reptiles and even mammals.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Building the Skyline: The Birth and Growth of Manhattan&#8217;s Skyscrapers</b><div><b><i><br></i></b></div><div><i>Katharine L. Shester reviews a book by Jason Barr about the development of NewYork City</i><br></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>In Building the Skyline, Jason Barr takes the reader through a detailed history of New York City. The book combines geology, history, economics, and a lot of data to explain why business clusters developed where they did and how the early decisions of workers and firms shaped the skyline we see today. Building the Skyline is organized into two distinct parts. The first is primarily historical and addresses New York&#8217;s settlement and growth from 1609 to 1900; the second deals primarily with the 20th century and is a compilation of chapters commenting on different aspects of New York&#8217;s urban development. The tone and organization of the book changes somewhat between the first and second parts, as the latter chapters incorporate aspects of Barr&#8217;s related research papers.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Barr begins chapter one by taking the reader on a &#8216;helicopter time-machine&#8217; ride &#8211; giving a fascinating account of how the New York landscape in 1609 might have looked from the sky. He then moves on to a subterranean walking tour of the city, indicating the location of rock and water below the subsoil, before taking the reader back to the surface. His love of the city comes through as he describes various fun facts about the location of the New York residence of early 19th-century vice-president Aaron Burr as well as a number of legends about the city.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Chapters two and three take the reader up to the Civil War (1861&#8211;1865), with chapter two focusing on the early development of land and the implementation of a grid system in 1811. Chapter three focuses on land use before the Civil War. Both chapters are informative and well researched and set the stage for the economic analysis that comes later in the book. I would have liked Barr to expand upon his claim that existing tenements* prevented skyscrapers in certain neighborhoods because &#8216;likely no skyscraper developer was interested in performing the necessary &#8220;slum clearance&#8221;&#8217;. Later in the book, Barr makes the claim that the depth of bedrock** was not a limiting factor for developers, as foundation costs were a small fraction of the cost of development. At first glance, it is not obvious why slum clearance would be limiting, while more expensive foundations would not.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i><u>* a tenement: a multi-occupancy building of any sort, but particularly a run-down apartment building or slum building<br></u></i></div><div><i><u>** bedrock: the solid, hard rock in the ground that lies under a loose layer of soil</u></i><br></div><div><i><u><br></u></i></div><div>Chapter four focuses on immigration and the location of neighborhoods and tenements in the late 19th century. Barr identifies four primary immigrant enclaves and analyzes their locations in terms of the amenities available in the area. Most of these enclaves were located on the least valuable land, between the industries located on the waterfront and the wealthy neighborhoods bordering Central Park.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Part two of the book begins with a discussion of the economics of skyscraper height. In chapter five, Barr distinguishes between engineering height, economic height, and developer height &#8212; where engineering height is the tallest building that can be safely made at a given time, economic height is the height that is most efficient from society&#8217;s point of view, and developer height is the actual height chosen by the developer, who is attempting to maximize return on investment.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Chapter five also has an interesting discussion of the technological advances that led to the construction of skyscrapers. For example, the introduction of iron and steel skeletal frames made thick, load-bearing walls unnecessary, expanding the usable square footage of buildings and increasing the use of windows and availability of natural light. Chapter six then presents data on building height throughout the 20th century and uses regression analysis to &#8216;predict&#8217; building construction. While less technical than the research paper on which the chapter is based, it is probably more technical than would be preferred by a general audience.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Chapter seven tackles the &#8216;bedrock myth&#8217;, the assumption that the absence of bedrock close to the surface between Downtown and Midtown New York is the reason for skyscrapers not being built between the two urban centers. Rather, Barr argues that while deeper bedrock does increase foundation costs, these costs were neither prohibitively high nor were they large compared to the overall cost of building a skyscraper. What I enjoyed the most about this chapter was Barr&#8217;s discussion of how foundations are actually built. He describes the use of caissons, which enable workers to dig down for considerable distances, often below the water table, until they reach bedrock. Barr&#8217;s thorough technological history discusses not only how caissons work, but also the dangers involved. While this chapter references empirical research papers, it is a relatively easy read.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Chapters eight and nine focus on the birth of Midtown and the building boom of the 1920s. Chapter eight contains lengthy discussions of urban economic theory that may serve as a distraction to readers primarily interested in New York. However, they would be well-suited for undergraduates learning about the economics of cities. In the next chapter, Barr considers two of the primary explanations for the building boom of the 1920s &#8212; the first being exuberance, and the second being financing. He uses data to assess the viability of these two explanations and finds that supply and demand factors explain much of the development of the 1920s; though it enabled the boom, cheap credit was not, he argues, the primary cause.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In the final chapter (chapter 10), Barr discusses another of his empirical papers that estimates Manhattan land values from the mid-19th century to the present day. The data work that went into these estimations is particularly impressive. Toward the end of the chapter, Barr assesses &#8216;whether skyscrapers are a cause or an effect of high land values&#8217;. He finds that changes in land values predict future building height, but the reverse is not true. The book ends with an epilogue, in which Barr discusses the impact of climate change on the city and makes policy suggestions for New York going forward.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Bats to the rescue</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><i>How Madagascar&#8217;s bats are helping to save the rainforest</i><br></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>There are few places in the world where relations between agriculture and conservation are more strained. Madagascar&#8217;s forests are being converted to agricultural land at a rate of one percent every year. Much of this destruction is fuelled by the cultivation of the country&#8217;s main staple crop: rice. And a key reason for this destruction is that insect pests are destroying vast quantities of what is grown by local subsistence farmers, leading them to clear forest to create new paddy fields. The result is devastating habitat and biodiversity loss on the island, but not all species are suffering. In fact, some of the island&#8217;s insectivorous bats are currently thriving and this has important implications for farmers and conservationists alike.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Enter University of Cambridge zoologist Ricardo Rocha. He&#8217;s passionate about conservation, and bats. More specifically, he&#8217;s interested in how bats are responding to human activity and deforestation in particular. Rocha&#8217;s new study shows that several species of bats are giving Madagascar&#8217;s rice farmers a vital pest control service by feasting on plagues of insects. And this, he believes, can ease the financial pressure on farmers to turn forest into fields.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Bats comprise roughly one-fifth of all mammal species in Madagascar and thirty-six recorded bat species are native to the island, making it one of the most important regions for conservation of this animal group anywhere in the world.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Co-leading an international team of scientists, Rocha found that several species of indigenous bats are taking advantage of habitat modification to hunt insects swarming above the country&#8217;s rice fields. They include the Malagasy mouse-eared bat, Major&#8217;s long-fingered bat, the Malagasy white-bellied free-tailed bat and Peters&#8217; wrinkle-lipped bat.<br></div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;These winner species are providing a valuable free service to Madagascar as biological pest suppressors,&#8217; says Rocha. &#8216;We found that six species of bat are preying on rice pests, including the paddy swarming caterpillar and grass webworm. The damage which these insects cause puts the island&#8217;s farmers under huge financial pressure and that encourages deforestation.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div>The study, now published in the journal Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, set out to investigate the feeding activity of insectivorous bats in the farmland bordering the Ranomafana National Park in the southeast of the country.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Rocha and his team used state-of-the-art ultrasonic recorders to record over a thousand bat &#8216;feeding buzzes&#8217; (echolocation sequences used by bats to target their prey) at 54 sites, in order to identify the favourite feeding spots of the bats. They next used DNA barcoding techniques to analyse droppings collected from bats at the different sites.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The recordings revealed that bat activity over rice fields was much higher than it was in continuous forest &#8211; seven times higher over rice fields which were on flat ground, and sixteen times higher over fields on the sides of hills &#8211; leaving no doubt that the animals are preferentially foraging in these man-made ecosystems. The researchers suggest that the bats favour these fields because lack of water and nutrient run-off make these crops more susceptible to insect pest infestations. DNA analysis showed that all six species of bat had fed on economically important insect pests. While the findings indicated that rice farming benefits most from the bats, the scientists also found indications that the bats were consuming pests of other crops, including the black twig borer (which infests coffee plants), the sugarcane cicada, the macadamia nut-borer, and the sober tabby (a pest of citrus fruits).<br></div><div><br></div><div>&#8216;The effectiveness of bats as pest controllers has already been proven in the USA and Catalonia,&#8217; said co-author James Kemp, from the University of Lisbon. &#8216;But our study is the first to show this happening in Madagascar, where the stakes for both farmers and conservationists are so high.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Local people may have a further reason to be grateful to their bats. While the animal is often associated with spreading disease, Rocha and his team found evidence that Malagasy bats feed not just on crop pests but also on mosquitoes &#8211; carriers of malaria, Rift Valley fever virus and elephantiasis &#8211; as well as blackflies, which spread river blindness.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Rocha points out that the relationship is complicated. When food is scarce, bats become a crucial source of protein for local people. Even the children will hunt them. And as well as roosting in trees, the bats sometimes roost in buildings, but are not welcomed there because they make them unclean. At the same time, however, they are associated with sacred caves and the ancestors, so they can be viewed as beings between worlds, which makes them very significant in the culture of the people. And one potential problem is that while these bats are benefiting from farming, at the same time deforestation is reducing the places where they can roost, which could have long-term effects on their numbers. Rocha says, &#8216;With the right help, we hope that farmers can promote this mutually beneficial relationship by installing bat houses.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Rocha and his colleagues believe that maximising bat populations can help to boost crop yields and promote sustainable livelihoods. The team is now calling for further research to quantify this contribution. &#8216;I&#8217;m very optimistic,&#8217; says Rocha. &#8216;If we give nature a hand, we can speed up the process of regeneration.&#8217;<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Does education fuel economic growth?</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>A</b></div><div>Over the last decade, a huge database about the lives of southwest German villagers between 1600 and 1900 has been compiled by a team led by Professor Sheilagh Ogilvie at Cambridge University&#8217;s Faculty of Economics. It includes court records, guild ledgers, parish registers, village censuses, tax lists and &#8211; the most recent addition &#8211; 9,000 handwritten inventories listing over a million personal possessions belonging to ordinary women and men across three centuries. Ogilvie, who discovered the inventories in the archives of two German communities 30 years ago, believes they may hold the answer to a conundrum that has long puzzled economists: the lack of evidence for a causal link between education and a country&#8217;s economic growth.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>As Ogilvie explains, &#8216;Education helps us to work more productively, invent better technology, and earn more ... surely it must be&#160;<span>critical for economic growth? But, if you look back through history, there&#8217;s no evidence that having a high literacy rate made a country industrialise earlier.&#8217; Between 1600 and 1900, England had only mediocre literacy rates by European standards, yet its economy grew fast and it was the first country to industrialise. During this period, Germany and Scandinavia had excellent literacy rates, but their economies grew slowly and they industrialised late. &#8216;Modern cross-country analyses have also struggled to find evidence that education causes economic growth, even though there is plenty of evidence that growth increases education,&#8217; she adds.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>C</b></span></div><div><span><span>In the handwritten inventories that Ogilvie is analysing are the belongings of women and men at marriage, remarriage and death. From badger skins to Bibles, sewing machines to scarlet bodices &#8211; the villagers&#8217; entire worldly goods are included. Inventories of agricultural equipment and craft tools reveal economic activities; ownership of books and education- related objects like pens and slates suggests how people learned. In addition, the tax lists included in the database record the value of farms, workshops, assets and debts; signatures and people&#8217;s estimates of their age indicate literacy and numeracy levels; and court records reveal obstacles (such as the activities of the guilds*) that stifled industry.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>Previous studies usually had just one way of linking education with economic growth &#8211; the presence of schools and printing presses, perhaps, or school enrolment, or the ability to sign names. According to Ogilvie, the database provides multiple indicators for the same individuals, making it possible to analyse links between literacy, numeracy, wealth, and industriousness, for individual women and men over the long term.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><u><i>* guild: an association of artisans or merchants which oversees the practice of their craft or trade in a particular area</i></u></span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>D</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>Ogilvie and her team have been building the vast database of material possessions on top of their full demographic reconstruction of the people who lived in these two German communities. &#8216;We can follow the same people &#8211; and their descendants &#8211; across 300 years of educational and economic change,&#8217; she says. Individual lives have unfolded before their eyes. Stories like that of the 24-year-olds Ana Regina and Magdalena Riethm&#252;llerin, who were chastised in 1707 for reading books in church instead of listening to the sermon. &#8216;This tells us they were continuing to develop their reading skills at least a decade after leaving school,&#8217; explains Ogilvie. The database also reveals the case of Juliana Schweickherdt, a 50-year-old spinster living in the small Black Forest community of Wildberg, who was reprimanded in 1752 by the local weavers&#8217; guild for &#8216;weaving cloth and combing wool, counter to the guild ordinance&#8217;. When Juliana continued taking jobs reserved for male guild members, she was summoned before the guild court and told to pay a fine equivalent to one third of a servant&#8217;s annual wage. It was a small act of defiance by today&#8217;s standards, but it reflects a time when laws in Germany and elsewhere regulated people&#8217;s access to labour markets. The dominance of guilds not only prevented people from using their skills, but also held back even the simplest industrial innovation.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>E</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>The data-gathering phase of the project has been completed and now, according to Ogilvie, it is time &#8216;to ask the big questions&#8217;. One way to look at whether education causes economic growth is to &#8216;hold wealth constant&#8217;. This involves following the lives of different people with the same level of wealth over a period of time. If wealth is constant, it is possible to discover whether education was, for example, linked to the cultivation of new crops, or to the adoption of industrial innovations like sewing machines. The team will also ask what aspect of education helped people engage more with productive and innovative activities. Was it, for instance, literacy, numeracy, book ownership, years of schooling? Was there a threshold level &#8211; a tipping point &#8211; that needed to be reached to affect economic performance?</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>F</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>Ogilvie hopes to start finding answers to these questions over the next few years. One thing is already clear, she says: the relationship between education and economic growth is far from straightforward. &#8216;German-speaking central Europe is an excellent laboratory for testing theories of economic growth,&#8217; she explains. Between 1600 and 1900, literacy rates and book ownership were high and yet the region remained poor. It was also the case that local guilds and merchant associations were extremely powerful and legislated against anything that undermined their monopolies. In villages throughout the region, guilds blocked labour migration and resisted changes that might reduce their influence.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span>&#8216;Early findings suggest that the potential benefits of education for the economy can be held back by other barriers, and this has implications for today,&#8217; says Ogilvie. &#8216;Huge amounts are spent improving education in developing countries, but this spending can fail to deliver economic growth if restrictions block people &#8211; especially women and the poor &#8211; from using their education in economically productive ways. If economic institutions are poorly set up, for instance, education can&#8217;t lead to growth.&#8217;</span><br></span></div>",

          "content": "<b>Timur Gareyev &#8211; blindfold chess champion</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>A</b></div><div>Next month, a chess player named Timur Gareyev will take on nearly 50 opponents at once. But that is not the hard part. While his challengers will play the games as normal, Gareyev himself will be blindfolded. Even by world record standards, it sets a high bar for human performance. The 28-year-old already stands out in the rarefied world of blindfold chess. He has a fondness for bright clothes and unusual hairstyles, and he gets his kicks from the adventure sport of BASE jumping. He has already proved himself a strong chess player, too. In a 10-hour chess marathon in 2013, Gareyev played 33 games in his head simultaneously. He won 29 and lost none. The skill has become his brand: he calls himself the Blindfold King.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>But Gareyev&#8217;s prowess has drawn interest from beyond the chess-playing community. In the hope of understanding how he and others like him can perform such mental feats, researchers at the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA) called him in for tests. They now have their first results. &#8216;The ability to play a game of chess with your eyes closed is not a far reach for most accomplished players,&#8217; said Jesse Rissman, who runs a memory lab at UCLA. &#8216;But the thing that&#8217;s so remarkable about Timur and a few other individuals is the number of games they can keep active at once. To me it is simply astonishing.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>Gareyev learned to play chess in his native Uzbekistan when he was six years old. Tutored by his grandfather, he entered his first tournament aged eight and soon became obsessed with competitions. At 16, he was crowned Asia&#8217;s youngest ever chess grandmaster. He moved to the US soon after, and as a student helped his university win its first national chess championship. In 2013, Gareyev was ranked the third best chess player in the US.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>To the uninitiated, blindfold chess seems to call for superhuman skill. But displays of the feat go back centuries. The first recorded game in Europe was played in 13th-century Florence. In 1947, the Argentinian grandmaster Miguel Najdorf played 45 simultaneous games in his mind, winning 39 in the 24-hour session.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>Accomplished players can develop the skill of playing blind even without realising it. The nature of the game is to run through possible moves in the mind to see how they play out. From this, regular players develop a memory for the patterns the pieces make, the defences and attacks. &#8216;You recreate it in your mind,&#8217; said Gareyev. &#8216;A lot of players are capable of doing what I&#8217;m doing.&#8217; The real mental challenge comes from playing multiple games at once in the head. Not only must the positions of each piece on every board be memorised, they must be recalled&#160;faithfully when needed, updated with each player&#8217;s moves, and then reliably stored again, so the brain can move on to the next board. First moves can be tough to remember because they are fairly uninteresting. But the ends of games are taxing too, as exhaustion sets in. When Gareyev is tired, his recall can get patchy. He sometimes makes moves based on only a fragmented memory of the pieces&#8217; positions.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>The scientists first had Gareyev perform some standard memory tests. These assessed his ability to hold numbers, pictures and words in mind. One classic test measures how many numbers a person can repeat, both forwards and backwards, soon after hearing them. Most people manage about seven. &#8216;He was not exceptional on any of these standard tests,&#8217; said Rissman. &#8216;We didn&#8217;t find anything other than playing chess that he seems to be supremely gifted at.&#8217; But next came the brain scans. With Gareyev lying down in the machine, Rissman looked at how well connected the various regions of the chess player&#8217;s brain were. Though the results are tentative and as yet unpublished, the scans found much greater than average communication between parts of Gareyev&#8217;s brain that make up what is called the frontoparietal control network. Of 63 people scanned alongside the chess player, only one or two scored more highly on the measure. &#8216;You use this network in almost any complex task. It helps you to allocate attention, keep rules in mind, and work out whether you should be responding or not,&#8217; said Rissman.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>G</b></div><div>It was not the only hint of something special in Gareyev&#8217;s brain. The scans also suggest that Gareyev&#8217;s visual network is more highly connected to other brain parts than usual. Initial results suggest that the areas of his brain that process visual images &#8211; such as chess boards &#8211; may have stronger links to other brain regions, and so be more powerful than normal. While the analyses are not finalised yet, they may hold the first clues to Gareyev&#8217;s extraordinary ability.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>H</b></div><div>For the world record attempt, Gareyev hopes to play 47 blindfold games at once in about 16 hours. He will need to win 80% to claim the title. &#8216;I don&#8217;t worry too much about the winning percentage, that&#8217;s never been an issue for me,&#8217; he said. &#8216;The most important part of blindfold chess for me is that I have found the one thing that I can fully dedicate myself to. I miss having an obsession.&#8217;<br></div>",

However, when the anxiety is out of proportion to the danger inherent in a given situation, is persistent and is markedly disabling, an anxiety disorder can be developed.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Anxiety is an emotion that all people experience from time to time, and we do that for very good reasons. It has been built into us; we have inherited it from our evolutionary past, because, in general, anxiety has a survival function. If there is a real danger for a primitive man, then anxiety kicks in in an adaptive way. We freeze, we stop doing whatever we were doing, we devote all of your attention to the danger, and our bodies react with a big release of adrenalin, an increase in blood flow to the muscles, getting us ready to run as fast as we can or fight as fiercely as we can.<br></div><div><br></div><div>So some anxiety is adaptive, not only for primitive man, but in modern society as well. It helps us to focus on things when we have deadlines and, if someone is driving too fast when we cross the road, it helps us to jump out of the way quickly. So, there is nothing wrong with anxiety in general, and in fact, we would have difficulties if we did not experience it to some extent, but of course it can get problematic if the danger is one that is imagined rather than real, or the danger is something that is exaggerated. In those cases, particularly if the perceived danger is out of proportion to the real danger, and it is persistent and disabling, then there is a danger of an anxiety disorder. About 17 per cent of the population will have an anxiety disorder at some stage in their life.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Anxiety can be caused in a variety of different ways, but any mental disorder is always difficult to diagnose. Scientists are looking at what role genes play in the development of these disorders and are also investigating the effects of environmental factors, such as pollution, physical and psychological stress, and diet. Several parts of the brain are key actors in the production of fear and anxiety. Using brain imaging technology and neurochemical techniques, scientists have discovered that the amygdala plays a significant role in most anxiety disorders. By learning more about how the brain creates fear and anxiety, scientists may be able to devise better treatments for these disorders.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Anxiety disorders are a very costly problem in terms of society. Some published figures show that, in the US, it cost $60 billion in one year in terms of lost productivity and in terms of excessive medical investigations that many people with anxiety seek, often thinking they have a physical problem.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Given all of this, it is rather worrying that anxiety also has a rather low treatment-seeking rate. Only 10 per cent of people with an anxiety disorder will seek treatment. That seems to be largely because people do not realise there are effective treatments available. Most people tend to think they have had it for most of their lives, so it is just their personality and they cannot change their personality, and so they feel rather hopeless about it.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The first psychotherapy treatment that was shown to be effective was exposure therapy, which essentially encourages people in a graded way to go into their feared situations and stay in them as long as they can and build up their confidence that way. Often, the therapist will accompany the&#160;person to a feared situation to provide support and guidance. Group cognitive behaviour therapy has also been shown to be effective. This is a talking therapy that helps people to understand the link between negative thoughts and mood and how altering their behaviour can enable them to manage anxiety and feel in control.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There are, of course, drugs that can help people with anxiety. Medication will not cure an anxiety disorder, but it can keep it under control while the person receives psychotherapy. The principal medications used for anxiety disorders are antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, and beta-blockers to control some of the physical symptoms. With proper treatment, many people with anxiety disorders can lead normal, fulfilling lives.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There is plenty of evidence that exercise can help with anxiety problems. When stress affects the brain, with its many nerve connections, the rest of the body feels the impact as well. Exercise and other physical activity produce endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers. In addition to this, getting physically tired can help people fall asleep faster and have deeper and more relaxing sleep. As many people suffering from anxiety often have problems with insomnia, just the ability to get a good night&#8217;s rest can change people&#8217;s whole perspectives.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Anxiety is a normal, but highly subjective, human emotion. While normal anxiety serves a beneficial and adaptive purpose, anxiety can also become the cause of tremendous suffering for millions of people. It is important that people recognise excessive anxiety in themselves as soon as possible, as treatment can be very successful and living untreated can be a misery.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u><br></div><div><u><br></u></div><div>Amygdala - a section of the brain that is responsible for detecting fear.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Grand Bank</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>The Grand Banks is a large area of submerged highlands southeast of Newfoundland and east of the Laurentian Channel on the North American continental shelf. Covering 93,200 square kilometres, the Grand Banks are relatively shallow, ranging from 25 to 100 meters in depth. It is in this area that the cold Labrador Current mixes with the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. The mixing of these waters and the shape of the ocean bottom lifts nutrients to the surface and these conditions created one of the richest fishing grounds in the world. Extensive marine life flourishes in the Grand Banks, whose range extends beyond the Canadian 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and into international waters. This has made it an important part of both the Canadian and the high seas fisheries, with fishermen risking their lives in the extremely inhospitable environment consisting of rogue waves, fog, icebergs, sea ice, hurricanes, winter storms and earthquakes.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>While the area&#8217;s &#8216;official&#8217; discovery is credited to John Cabot in 1497, English and Portuguese vessels are known to have first sought out these waters prior to that, based upon reports they received from earlier Viking voyages to Newfoundland. Several navigators, including Basque fishermen, are known to have fished these waters in the fifteenth century. Some texts from that era refer to a land called Bacalao, &#8216;the land of the codfish&#8217;, which is possibly Newfoundland. However, it was not until John Cabot noted the waters&#8217; abundance of sea life that the existence of these fishing grounds became widely known in Europe. Soon, fishermen and merchants from France, Spain, Portugal and England developed seasonal inshore fisheries producing for European markets. Known as &#8216;dry&#8217; fishery, cod were split, salted, and dried on shore over the summer before crews returned to Europe. The French pioneered &#8216;wet&#8217; or &#8216;green&#8217; fishery on the Grand Banks proper around 1550, heavily salting the cod on board and immediately returning home.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>The Grand Banks were possibly the world&#8217;s most important international fishing area in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Technological advances in fishing, such as sonar and large factory ships, including the massive factory freezer trawlers introduced in the 1950&#8217;s, led to overfishing and a serious decline in the fish stocks. Based upon the many foreign policy agreements Newfoundland had entered into prior to its admittance into the Canadian Confederation, foreign fleets, some from as far away as Russia, came to the Grand Banks in force, catching unprecedented quantities of fish.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>Between 1973 and 1982, the United Nations and its member states negotiated the Third Convention of the Law of the Sea, one component of which was the concept of nations being allowed to declare an EEZ. Many nations worldwide-declared 200-nautical mile EEZ&#8217;s, including Canada and the United States. On the whole, the EEZ was very well received by fishermen in eastern Canada, because it meant they could fish unhindered out to the limit without fear of competing with the foreign fleets. During the late 1970&#8217;s and early 1980s, Canada&#8217;s domestic offshore fleet grew as fishermen and fish processing companies rushed to take advantage. It was during this time that it was noticed that the foreign fleets now pushed out to areas of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland outside the Canadian EEZ. By the late 1980&#8217;s, dwindling catches of Atlantic cod were being reported throughout Newfoundland and eastern Canada, and the federal government and citizens of coastal regions in the area began to face the reality that the domestic and foreign overfishing had taken its toll. The Canadian government was finally forced to take drastic action in 1992, when a total moratorium was declared indefinitely for the northern cod.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>Over the last ten years, it has been noted that cod appear to be returning to the Grand Banks in small numbers. The reasons for this fragile recovery are still unknown. Perhaps, the damage done by trawlers is not permanent and the marine fauna and ecosystems can rebuild themselves if given a prolonged period of time without any commercial activity. Either way, the early stage recovery of the Grand Banks is encouraging news, but caution is needed, as, after nearly twenty years of severe limitations, cod stocks are still only at approximately ten per cent of 1960&#8217;s levels. It is hoped that in another ten to twenty years, stocks may be close to a full recovery, although this would require political pressure to maintain strict limitations on commercial fishing. If cod do come back to the Grand Banks in meaningful numbers, it is to be hoped that the Canadians will not make the same mistakes again.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>Further riches have now been found in the Grand Banks. Petroleum reserves have been discovered and a number of oil fields are under development in the region. The vast Hibernia oil field was discovered in 1979, and, following several years of aborted start-up attempts, the Hibernia megaproject began construction of the production platform and gravity base structures in the early 1990&#8217;s. Production commenced on November 17, 1997, with initial production rates in excess of 50,000 barrels of crude oil per day from a single well. Hibernia has proven to be the most prolific oil well in Canada. However, earthquake and iceberg activity in the Grand Banks pose a potential ecological disaster that could devastate the fishing grounds that are only now starting to recover.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>An Aging Population</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>People are living longer and, in some parts of the world, healthier lives. This represents one of the crowning achievements of the last century, but also a significant challenge. Longer lives must be planned for. Societal aging may affect economic growth and lead to many other issues, including the sustainability of families, the ability of states and communities to provide resources for older citizens, and international relations. The Global Burden of Disease, a study conducted by the World Health Organization, predicts a very large increase in age-related chronic disease in all regions of the world. Dealing with this will be a significant challenge for all countries&#8217; health services.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Population aging is driven by declines in fertility and improvements in health and longevity. In more developed countries, falling fertility beginning in the early 1900&#8217;s has resulted in current levels being below the population replacement rate of two live births per woman. Perhaps the most surprising demographic development of the past 20 years has been the pace of fertility decline in many less developed countries. In 2006, for example, the total fertility rate was at or below the replacement rate in 44 less developed countries.<br></div><div><br></div><div>One central issue for policymakers in regard to pension funds is the relationship between the official retirement age and actual retirement age. Over several decades in the latter part of the 20th century, many of the more developed nations lowered the official age at which people become fully entitled to public pension benefits. This was propelled by general economic conditions, changes in welfare philosophy, and private pension trends. Despite the recent trend toward increased workforce participation at older ages, a significant gap between official and actual ages of retirement persists. This trend is emerging in rapidly aging developing countries as well. Many countries already have taken steps towards much-needed reform of their old-age social insurance programs. One common reform has been to raise the age at which workers are eligible for full public pension benefits. Another strategy for bolstering economic security for older people has been to increase the contributions by workers. Other measures to enhance income for older people include new financial instruments for private savings, tax incentives for individual retirement savings, and supplemental occupational pension plans.<br></div><div><br></div><div>As life expectancy increases in most nations, so do the odds of different generations within a family coexisting. In more developed countries, this has manifested itself as the &#8216;beanpole family,&#8217; a vertical extension of family structure characterised by an increase in the number of living generations within a lineage and a decrease in the number of people within each generation. As mortality rates continue to improve, more people in their 50&#8217;s and 60&#8217;s will have surviving parents, aunts, and uncles. Consequently, more children will know their grandparents and even their great-grandparents, especially their great-grandmothers. There is no precedent for a majority of middle-aged and older adults having living parents.<br></div><div><br></div><div>As the World Health Organisation study, The Global Burden of Disease, predicts that in a few decades the loss of health and life worldwide will be greater from non-communicable or chronic diseases than from infectious diseases, childhood diseases, and accidents. The study estimates that today, noncommunicable diseases account for 85 per cent of the burden of disease in high-income countries and a surprising 44 per cent of the burden of disease in low- and middle-income countries. Noncommunicable diseases already account for as much of the burden of disease in low- and middleincome countries as all communicable diseases, maternal and perinatal conditions, and nutritional conditions. By 2030, according to projections, the share of the burden attributed to noncommunicable diseases in low- and middle-income countries will reach 54 per cent, while the share attributed to communicable diseases will fall to 32 per cent. If we restrict attention to older ages, noncommunicable diseases already account for more than 87 per cent of the burden for the over-60 population in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. The critical issue for low- and middle-income countries is how to mobilise and allocate resources to address non-communicable diseases, as they continue to struggle with the continued high prevalence of communicable diseases. Of course, a significant jump in disability numbers has accompanied the increase in longevity.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Because countries age at different paces, it is possible for the elements of production - labour and capital - to flow across national boundaries and mitigate the impact of population aging. Studies predict that, in the near term, surplus capital will flow from Europe and North America to emerging markets in Asia and Latin America, where the population is younger and cheaper and supplies of capital relatively low. In another 20 years, when the baby boom generation in the West has mostly retired, capital will most likely flow in the opposite direction. However, these studies rest on the uncertain assumption that capital will flow easily across national boundaries.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Despite the weight of scientific evidence, the significance of population aging and its global implications have yet to be wholly appreciated. There is a need to raise awareness about not only global aging issues, but also the importance of rigorous cross-national scientific research and policy dialogue that will help us address the challenges and opportunities of an aging world. Preparing financially for longer lives and finding ways to reduce aging-related disability should become national and global priorities. Experience shows that for nations, as for individuals, it is critical to address problems sooner rather than later. Waiting significantly increases the costs and difficulties of addressing these challenges.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Igloo</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>The igloo is the traditional shelter of Inuit living in the far northern regions. They are built of blocks of snow in a circular shape, in which the walls curve inward towards the top to form a snow vault with a self-supporting arched ceiling. An outstanding example of human ingenuity and adaptability to the environment, the igloo retains heat and protects against the cold, since snow and ice act as excellent insulation. The design includes a tunnel entrance that forms a cold trap to preserve heat inside. The sleeping and sitting areas are raised above this and so maintain a higher temperature.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A similar construction is the &#8216;quinzhee&#8217;, which is a shelter made by hollowing out a pile of settled snow, and is only for temporary use. In contemporary times, this type of snow shelter has become popular among those who enjoy winter camping, as well as in survival situations. Some contemporary Inuit though continue to use igloos, especially as temporary shelters while hunting. However, the warming climate of the early twenty-first century has reduced the availability of appropriate snow for igloo construction. Although the traditional art of igloo construction by Inuit natives may have declined, the igloo and variations upon it, such as ice hotels, have gained in popularity among those who enjoy the winter experience.<br></div><div><br></div><div>An igloo in the Inuit language simply means house and the Inuit do not restrict the use of this term exclusively to snow houses, but include traditional tents, sod houses, homes constructed of driftwood, and modern buildings. Although the origin of the igloo may have been lost in antiquity, it is known that Inuit have constructed snow igloos for hundreds of years. Living in an area where snow and ice predominate, particularly in the long dark winter above the Arctic Circle, the igloo is the perfect shelter. Snow is used because the air pockets trapped in it make it an excellent insulator. Outside, temperatures may be as low as minus 45 degrees Celsius, but inside an igloo, the temperature may range from minus 7 degrees Celsius to 16 degrees Celsius when warmed by body heat alone. A highly functional shelter, the igloo is also aesthetically pleasing, with its shape being both strong and beautiful.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In order to build an igloo, there is a fairly standard procedure. The first thing to do is to find a good spot. It is vital to choose a safe location away from avalanche prone slopes. Next, mark a circle in the snow. For two people, a circle of around two metres diameter is needed, and for four people, around four metres. The igloo body is the next step. Shovel a pile of snow into a large, reasonably steep mound and try and keep the sloping sides at an angle of around 35 degrees or higher, which is best for stability. Wide, short snow shelters are more prone to collapse. If possible, mix snow of different temperatures to help it to harden. The entrance is done by digging a trench downwards into the snow towards the mound. This should be on the downhill side and out of the wind. The snow that is being removed from the trench should be placed on top of the mound. In these conditions, make the trench&#160;as deep as a standing man. Then, leave everything for about 90 minutes if possible. Next, finish the tunnel entrance. Make the tunnel slightly wider than a body&#8217;s width and dig at a slightly upward angle. Ideally, the floor of the snow shelter should be at least 30 centimetres above the entrance, which will help prevent warm air from escaping the shelter. After the initial entrance is made, it is easier to hollow the inside from the top down. The walls should be thirty to sixty centimetres thick, and if the inside walls are smoothed, this will help prevent dripping. Leave an elevated platform for sleeping on. As heat rises, the occupants will be in the warmest part of the igloo for sleeping. A very important point is to make an air vent in the wall of the shelter, which will prevent the occupants from suffocating in the night. Finally, block the entrance with a block of snow or a rucksack.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Igloo hotels are a new variation on the traditional igloo. In several winter destinations, villages of igloos are built for tourists, where the guests use sleeping bags that sit on top of reindeer hides in overnight stays. Ice hotels are found in many places in Norway, Finland, and Sweden, and are constructed each winter and melt in the spring. The Ice Hotel in the village of Jukkasj&#228;rvi, located next to the town of Kiruna in Sweden, is a famous attraction. Originally, the creators started out building a simple igloo, which later turned into the elaborate and now famous &#8216;hotel&#8217;. It is made from the waters of the adjacent river Torne, the pure waters of which produce beautiful clear ice used to create decorations, which are made entirely of snow and ice.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The igloo is a subject that has fascinated people from all over the world. Although the traditional art of igloo construction by Inuit natives may have declined, the igloo and variations on it have gained in popularity among those who enjoy the novelty and winter experience.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u><br></div><div><br></div><div>Inuit - native people of the northern regions of Canada, North America and Greenland.<br></div>",

And because computers can do anything, they can in particular run viruses and any other nasty software.<b><br></b></div><div><br></div><div>Viruses are unique in their abilities, as they can stop many computers at once. This would be much more serious for a small company than normal faults that affect only one PC at a time. Thus, viruses rank with hazards like power cuts and fire in their effect and speed of action. Worse than fire though, people may find that they cannot take their work elsewhere, for if they did, they might simply take the virus infection with them and bring more systems down. Secondly, viruses can distribute disinformation and bring shame to individuals or organisations: viruses may send malicious email apparently on behalf of the person whose computer has been infected.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A computer virus is a piece of program code that attaches copies of itself to other programs, incorporating itself into them, so that the modified programs, while still possibly performing their intended function, surreptitiously do other things. Programs so corrupted seek others to which to attach the virus, and so the infection circulates. Successful viruses lie low until they have thoroughly infiltrated the system, and only reveal their presence when they cause damage. The effect of a virus is rarely linked back to its originator, so viruses make attractive weapons for vandals. Computer viruses generally work by altering files that contain otherwise harmless programs. This is infection. When an infected program is invoked, it seeks other programs stored in files to which it has write permission, and infects them by modifying the files to include a copy of itself and inserting an instruction to branch to that code at the old program&#8217;s starting point. Then the virus starts up the original program, so that the user is unaware of its intervention. Viruses are classified as being one of two types: &#8216;research&#8217; or &#8216;in the wild&#8217;. A research virus is one that has been written for research or study purposes and has received almost no distribution to the public. On the other hand, viruses that have been seen with any regularity are termed &#8216;in the wild&#8217;.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Before the spread of the Internet, most computer viruses were spread by removable media, predominantly floppy disks. Some viruses spread by infecting programs stored on these disks, while others installed themselves into the disk boot sector. Until floppy disks were replaced by other removable media, this was the most successful infection strategy and boot sector viruses were the most common in the wild for many years.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The term &#8216;computer virus&#8217; is a popular catchall for all kinds of malicious software. A logic bomb is a destructive program activated by a certain combination of circumstances, or on a certain date, to delete information. A Trojan horse is any bug inserted into a computer program that takes advantage of the trusted status of its host by surreptitiously performing unintended functions. A worm is a distributed program that invades computers on a network. It consists of several processes or segments that keep in touch through the network; when one is lost, the others conspire to replace it on another server.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Viruses today have no distinct identity, but typically undergo mutation each time they copy themselves to other files. This, combined with various cryptographic techniques, makes modern viruses difficult to detect. False alarms have become an increasing problem, particularly with users sending chain email warning about supposed virus problems; ironically, the panics may cause more problems than the viruses they warn about. Email though has become the most popular way to disperse viruses today, because powerful commercial email packages are themselves programmable and users often configure email systems to helpfully run programs automatically.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Viruses are not difficult to develop. The majority of viruses are simple variants of others and many virus construction kits are readily available on the Internet. Viruses have been created since the 1960&#8217;s, although the term &#8216;computer virus&#8217; was only formally defined by Fred Cohen in 1983. One of the first virus attacks occurred in late 1987 when, over a two-month period, a virus quietly insinuated itself into programs at a Middle East university. It was noticed because it caused programs to grow longer. Once discovered, it was analysed and an antidote devised. It was designed to slow processors down on certain Fridays, and to erase all files on Friday, 13 May.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It is common that certain viruses have been given names. Once discovered and named, programmers can create &#8216;antidotes&#8217; that delete the viruses from the system. The obvious, but generally impractical defence against viruses is never to use anyone else&#8217;s software and never to connect with anyone else&#8217;s computer. A more practical approach to protect computers is to regularly or continuously run programs that recognise viruses and try to eliminate virus infections before they do too much damage. Because new viruses are being devised every day, it is important and sensible to keep detection programs up to date, by, for example, a subscription from a reputable firm, and to minimise risky procedures, such as sharing information as infrequently as possible.<br></div><div><br></div><div>All protection approaches are trade-offs. Eternal vigilance on the part of users is important, and, above all, education of users to the possible results of their actions.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Homeschooling</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>Homeschooling is a method of education where children do not attend a traditional school. Instead, usually parents take over the responsibility for the education of their children, either doing it all themselves or by using a company that specialises in providing homeschooling curricula and materials. Homeschooled children can excel in standardised testing and universities and colleges have no qualms about accepting them. Supporters also claim that because they have been trained early on to be independent learners, homeschooled individuals grow up to become reliable, resourceful individuals.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>Homeschooling offers various benefits. Almost all homeschooling families say that homeschooling has played an essential role in bringing their family closer, as the time that parents spend teaching their children, and the time the children spend learning together, can foster a loving relationship in the family. Homeschooled children do not have to worry about bullying, peer pressure and spiteful competition, so their self-esteem does not have to suffer needlessly, and many parents with children who have been the target of bullying have resorted to homeschooling to protect their children from the harmful effects of harassment. Another key advantage of homeschooling is that parents and children no longer have to work their lives around homework and school hours. They usually accomplish in a few hours each day what typically takes a week or more to complete in a classroom setting. Because they spend more time in hands-on learning, homeschooled children can do away with homework, which is what usually keeps public schooled children up late at night. Additionally, families can schedule off-season vacations, go on field trips or visit museums, zoos and parks during the week as part of their learning experience. A more controversial benefit of homeschooling is that parents have frequently much more say in what is taught to their children, so that they can avoid subjects which they disapprove of.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>Homeschooling is, however, sharply criticised in some quarters. A common criticism is that homeschooled children may not have as many opportunities to interact with other children in comparison to children who attend regular schools. Forming bonds and socialising with children his or her own age is important for a child&#8217;s developmental health and development of social skills. If homeschooled, children may be deprived of the chance to form friendships and may suffer socially. The lack of socialisation may affect them in later stages of life.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>Parents choosing to homeschool their children may also be faced with the common problem of time. Parents need to set aside time to make it work. The task of homeschooling a child is certainly not easy, whether for working parents, single parents or stay-at-home parents. They have to take time to organise and prepare lessons, teach, give tests, and plan field trips. Also, in comparison to public&#160;chools where education is free, homeschooling can also be costly, as purchasing the newest curriculum and teaching tools can be very expensive. Parents may choose to use a pre-prepared paid homeschooling program, but, in spite of the possible added benefits of such programs, they may increase the cost of the child&#8217;s education. There are also other costs to keep in mind, like project materials, stationery, books, computer software, and field trips.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>There is also the issue of the different relationships between parents and their children and teachers and their students. Public and private schools provide for many children a safe haven, in which they are both regarded and respected independently and individually. Family love is intense, and children need it to survive and thrive. It is also deeply contingent on the existence and nature of the family ties. The unconditional love children receive at home is actually anything but unconditional: it is conditioned on the fact that they are their parents&#8217; children. School, either public or private, ideally provides a welcome respite. Children are regarded and respected at school not because they are their parents&#8217; children, but because they are students. They are valued for traits and for status that are independent of their status as the parents&#8217; genetic or adoptive offspring. The ideal teacher cares about a child as an individual, a learner and an actively curious person. The teacher does not care about the child because the child is his or hers, and the child is regarded with respect equal to all the children in the class. In these ways, the school classroom, ideally, and the relations within it, is a model of some core aspects of citizenship.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>A final criticism of homeschooling is that there is a public health risk. Children who attend public schools are required to have immunisations in order to begin classes. It is hard in many countries to ensure that mandatory immunisation is verified. Thus, deregulated homeschooling means that homeschooled children are basically exempted from immunisation requirements. The children are more susceptible to the diseases against which immunisation gives some protection, and others around them, particularly the elderly, are also consequently in danger.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>Even given these potential harms, there remain good reasons to permit homeschooling in plenty of circumstances. Parents often justifiably wish to shield their children from public schools that too often ill serve children who are at risk of bullying, or who are hurt by the culture of middle and high schools. Some children also have special abilities or needs, or simply idiosyncratic learning styles or habits, and many of these children can best or even only be educated by those who know them best.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary<br></u></div><div><br></div><div>Qualms - Worries or fears<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Braille</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>Braille is a system of touch reading and writing for blind persons in which raised dots represent the letters of the alphabet. Braille also contains equivalents for punctuation marks and provides symbols to show letter groupings. Braille is read by moving the hand or hands from left to right along each line. Both hands are usually involved in the reading process, and reading is generally done with the index fingers. The average reading speed is about 125 words per minute, but greater speeds of up to 200 words per minute are possible.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>The history of Braille goes all the way back to the early 1800&#8217;s, when Charles Berbier developed a unique system known as &#8216;night writing,&#8217; so that soldiers could communicate safely during the night. Being a military veteran, Berbier had seen several soldiers killed, because they used lamps after dark to read combat messages. The light shining from the lamps told the enemy where the French soldiers were and this inevitably led to the loss of many men. Berbier based his night writing system on a raised 12-dot cell; two dots wide and six dots tall. Each dot or combination of dots within the cell denoted a letter or a phonetic sound. The problem with the military code was that the human fingertip could not feel all the dots with one touch.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>Louis Braille was born January 4, 1809, in a small village near Paris. His father, a leather worker, often used sharp tools in his work. While playing in his father&#8217;s shop when he was three, Louis injured his eye with an awl. In spite of good care, infection set in and soon left him completely blind. At eleven years old, Braille was inspired to modify Charles Berbier&#8217;s night writing code in an effort to create an efficient written communication system for fellow blind individuals. One year earlier, he had enrolled at the National Institute of the Blind in Paris and he spent the next nine years developing and refining the system of raised dots that has come to be known by his name, Braille.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>Braille&#8217;s code was based on cells with only six dots, instead of 12, as in Berbier&#8217;s. This improvement was crucial, because it meant that a fingertip could encompass the entire cell unit with one impression and move rapidly from one cell to the next. Over time, Braille gradually came to be accepted throughout the world as the fundamental form of written communication for blind individuals, and today it remains basically as he invented it. There have, however, been some small modifications to the Braille&#160;system. Partly because of the size that Braille pages occupy, and partly to improve the speed of writing and reading, the literary Braille codes for English and many other languages employ contractions that substitute shorter sequences for the full spelling of commonly occurring letter groups. For example, &#8216;the&#8217; is usually just one character in Braille. The use of contractions permits faster Braille reading and helps reduce the size of Braille books, making them much less cumbersome. Braille passed away in 1853 at the age of 43, a year before his home country of France adopted Braille as its official communication system for blind individuals. A few years later in 1860, Braille made its way to America, where it was adopted by many institutions.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>A modern application of Braille is its use with computers. Reading electronic documents using hands instead of eyes may sound almost impossible, however, this is actually what many blind persons can do nowadays. This is done through a device known as a Braille display. Braille displays are hardware that enable users to read in Braille the text displayed on the computer screen. Using this, blind people can navigate through the computer&#8217;s desktop, create and edit documents, and browse the Internet. Once connected to the computer, the Braille display will acquire the currently highlighted text on the screen. The screen reader will then translate the text into Braille and the Braille display will display it on its built-in Braille cells. Braille displays are refreshable, which means that when the user moves to a specific line of text, the device displays the text&#8217;s Braille equivalent. Then, when the user moves to another line, the device automatically displays that new line in Braille.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>The Braille display is just one of the devices used by blind people in accessing the computer and other electronic hardware. Apart from this device, blind people also use synthetic speech provided by screen readers, which reads electronic text in a semi-human voice. The main difference between Braille displays and synthetic speech is that Braille displays actually let users read text content. As screen readers only let users hear the text on the screen, Braille displays are more useful for users who are both deaf and blind.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>Louis Braille&#8217;s legacy has enlightened the lives of millions of people who are blind, and blind individuals from all over the world benefit from Braille&#8217;s work daily. Today, Braille code is transcribed in many different languages worldwide. Now people who are blind can enjoy all the printed word has to offer just like everyone else. The effect is tremendously empowering and helps them achieve success in school and in their careers.<br></div>",

A static black hole is one that is relatively simple to describe, as it does not rotate and it does not have a charge. A static black hole has three things of particular interest. The outer part is known as the photon sphere, so named as photons orbit the black hole here. Like all planets and stars, black holes have gravity, except much more than anything else. The photon sphere is the only place where light rays can have orbits around the black hole, though they are very unstable. The next point of interest is the event horizon. Like the photon sphere, this is just a mathematical distance based on gravity. Once something passes beyond the event horizon, it can never leave the black hole, as the gravitational pull is too strong. As even the light reflecting off an object will be drawn into a black hole, it is not possible to see something once it passes the event horizon. The centre of a black hole is the singularity and this where all the matter of a black hole from its origin lies, along with anything drawn in. The singularity is a difficult thing to describe. It is not a place, but more where the curvature of space time is infinite. It is not known what goes on there, but it is known that it depends on quantum mechanics.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Although the term was not coined until 1967 by Princeton physicist John Wheeler, the idea of an object in space so massive and dense that light cannot escape it has been around for centuries. Most famously, black holes were predicted by Einstein&#8217;s theory of general relativity, which showed that, when a massive star dies, it leaves behind a small and dense remnant core. If the core&#8217;s mass is more than about three times the mass of the Sun, Einstein&#8217;s equations showed that the force of gravity overwhelms all other forces and produces a black hole.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Scientists cannot directly observe black holes with telescopes that detect X-rays, light, or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. They can, however, infer the presence of black holes and study them by detecting their effect on other matter nearby. If a black hole passes through a cloud of interstellar matter, for example, it will draw matter inward in a process known as &#8216;accretion.&#8217; A similar process can occur if a normal star passes close to a black hole. In this case, the black hole can tear the star apart, as it pulls it toward itself. As the attracted matter accelerates and heats up, it emits X-rays that radiate into space. Recent discoveries offer some evidence that black holes have a dramatic influence on things around them, emitting powerful gamma ray bursts, absorbing nearby stars, and both stimulating and hindering the growth of new stars.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There is a good, relatively recent example of detecting a black hole from events near it. An international team of astronomers has identified a candidate for the smallest-known black hole using data from NASA&#8217;s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The evidence comes from a specific type of Xray pattern, nicknamed a &#8216;heartbeat,&#8217; because of its resemblance to an electrocardiogram. The pattern until now has been recorded in only one other black hole system. The system in question combines a normal star with a black hole that may weigh less than three times the Sun&#8217;s mass. That is, of course, near the theoretical mass boundary where black holes become possible. Gas from the normal star streams toward the black hole and forms a disk around it. Friction within the disk heats the gas to millions of degrees, which is hot enough to emit X-rays. Variations in the intensity of the X-rays observed reflect processes taking place within the gas disk. Therefore it is by observing the gas disk that scientists can predict the presence of the black hole, rather than seeing it itself, which is, of course, impossible.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Although the basic formation process is understood, one perennial mystery in the science of black holes is that they appear to exist on two radically different size scales. At the one end, there are the countless black holes that are the remnants of massive stars. Peppered throughout the Universe, these &#8216;stellar mass&#8217; black holes are generally 10 to 24 times as massive as the Sun. Astronomers spot them when other stars draw near enough for some of the matter surrounding them to be snared by the black hole&#8217;s gravity, churning out X-rays in the process. Most stellar black holes, however, lead isolated lives and are impossible to detect. Judging from the number of stars large enough to produce such black holes, however, scientists estimate that there are as many as ten million to a billion such black holes in the Milky Way alone. At the other end of the size spectrum are the giants known as &#8216;supermassive&#8217; black holes, which are millions, if not billions, of times as massive as the Sun. Astronomers believe that supermassive black holes lie at the middle of virtually all large galaxies. Astronomers can detect them by watching for their effects on nearby stars and gas.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>CCTV Surveillance</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>In recent years, a combination of perceptions and fears regarding increased street crime and advances in technology has seen an upsurge in the use of closed circuit television (CCTV) as a tool for tackling crime in public places. Many private companies and a number of local government authorities have initiated trials in the use of CCTV, and the technology is also being used in a number of ways in the public transport system.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Because CCTV is relatively new, it is still not clear how effective it is in deterring or reducing crime. Research evidence so far suggests that it is an effective strategy in situational crime prevention at a local level, but only as one of a range of crime prevention strategies. In addition, it appears from the research that CCTV is effective in addressing property crime and some types of assault and robbery. Of course, high-risk areas, for example jewellery shops, can greatly benefit from the visible deterrent of CCTV cameras.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Evidence also suggests that the benefits of CCTV surveillance fade after a period of time, and that displacement may occur, that is that the crime may simply move to other areas away from the CCTV surveillance, or there may be a shift to different sorts of crime that are less susceptible to CCTV surveillance. One important thing is that the reduction in crime that people believe CCTV brings can lead to enhanced perceptions of safety in a particular area, which makes communities happier and more satisfied with government actions.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In general, the issue of whether or not to consider implementing a CCTV scheme is likely to arise in response to a perception or awareness that there is a crime problem in a specific public place. This may be indicated by media coverage, by complaints to the council or other authorities or through police contact with the council. Once a council identifies that there is a problem, it needs to form a Community Safety Committee, which should study a broad range of crime prevention and community safety issues and evaluate various options for dealing with them.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Installing and trialling a CCTV scheme usually involves decisions about technical, financial and operational matters that may be beyond the expertise of a Community Safety Committee. Therefore, the establishment of a specialised CCTV Committee may be the appropriate way of ensuring sound management of the scheme. Alternatively, a program co-ordinator with experience in developing community safety initiatives could be appointed to manage the development of the CCTV program. Both of these should offer expert advice to the Community Safety Committee.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The Community Safety Committee must carry out a crime assessment of the area where problems have been identified. The analysis should be conducted in consultation with police, and, as appropriate, representatives of the local community. Once the crime assessment provides a clear&#160;picture of the nature of the criminal activities, a Crime Prevention Plan should be made. If the Committee believes that one of the strategies to address the problems identified in the crime assessment is the establishment of a CCTV program, it is essential that the Crime Prevention Plan outlines how this strategy is integrated with the broad plan objectives and why CCTV is considered appropriate.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There are various disadvantages and criticisms of CCTV. First is the perception that CCTV is an invasion of everyone&#8217;s privacy. It is argued that the steady expansion in the surveillance apparatus of the state and private sector has diminished the privacy of every individual, has lessened people&#8217;s trust in the state and poses a significant threat to personal privacy and individual freedom. Although in most countries there is nothing inherently unconstitutional in the use of surveillance by the state, there is nonetheless a danger that it may disturb some of the presumptions and relationships that underpin the relationship between the individual and the state. This is because mass surveillance promotes the view that everybody is untrustworthy. If governments gather data on people all the time, on the basis that they may do something wrong, this promotes a view that the citizens cannot be trusted.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There are also worries about the social effects of surveillance and the potential for discrimination. Cameras are installed so as to watch places and identified groups of people. Studies have shown that existing surveillance systems and databases with collected information may reflect biases that can exist in the social system, often based on factors such as race.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another problem with CCTV is the cost of installation and maintenance. As an example, over the last 20 years in the UK, approximately 78 per cent of the Home Office crime prevention budget was spent on installing CCTV. Where previously this money might have been spent on street lighting and supporting neighbourhood crime prevention initiatives, it is now used to maintain and expand the network of police and local authority cameras.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Protecting the public is a duty of government. However, surveillance and the use of collected personal information may lead to a conflict between the interests of the citizen and the goals of the state, and it has the potential to undermine privacy and limit the freedom of the individual. It seems that CCTV does not significantly stop crime, although when a crime has occurred, CCTV is a vital element of the investigative process. Therefore, as CCTV on its own can do little to address long-term crime prevention, CCTV should only be considered as one part of an integrated crime prevention strategy and should be installed on a trial basis subject to rigorous evaluation as to its usefulness.<br></div>",

The iconic waterway established settlement patterns for most of the United States during the nineteenth century, made New York the financial capital of the world, provided a critical supply line that helped the North win the Civil War, and precipitated a series of social and economic changes throughout a young America.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Explorers had long searched for a water route to the west. Throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the lack of an efficient and safe transportation network kept populations and trade largely confined to coastal areas. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the Allegheny Mountains were the Western Frontier. The Northwest Territories that would later become Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio were rich in timber, minerals, and fertile land for farming, but it took weeks to reach these things. Travellers were faced with rutted turnpike roads that baked to hardness in the summer sun. In the winter, the roads dissolved into mud.<br></div><div><br></div><div>An imprisoned flour merchant named Jesse Hawley envisioned a better way: a canal from Buffalo on the eastern shore of Lake Erie to Albany on the upper Hudson River, a distance of almost 400 miles. Long a proponent of efficient water transportation, Hawley had gone bankrupt trying to move his products to market. Hawley&#8217;s ideas caught the interest of Assemblyman Joshua Forman, who submitted the first state legislation related to the Erie Canal in 1808, calling for a series of surveys to be made examining the practicality of a water route between Lake Erie and the Hudson River. In 1810, Thomas Eddy, and State Senator Jonas Platt, hoping to get plans for the canal moving forward, approached influential Senator De Witt Clinton, former mayor of New York City, to enlist his support. Though Clinton had been recruited to the canal effort by Eddy and Platt, he quickly became one of the canal&#8217;s most active supporters and went on to successfully tie his very political fate to its success. On April 15th, 1817, the New York State Legislature finally approved construction of the Erie Canal. The Legislature authorised $7 million for construction of the 363-mile long waterway, which was to be 40 feet wide and eighteen feet deep. Construction began on July 4th 1817 and took eight years.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Like most canals, the Erie Canal depended on a lock system in order to compensate for changes in water levels over distance. A lock is a section of canal or river that is closed off to control the water&#160;level, so that boats can be raised or lowered as they pass through it. Locks have two sets of sluice gates (top and bottom), which seal off and then open the entrances to the chamber, which is where a boat waits while the movement up or down takes place. In addition, locks also have valves at the bottom of the sluice gates and it is by opening these valves that water is allowed into and out of the chamber to raise or lower the water level, and hence the boat.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The effect of the Erie Canal was both immediate and dramatic, and settlers poured west. The explosion of trade prophesied by Governor Clinton began, spurred by freight rates from Buffalo to New York of $10 per ton by canal, compared with $100 per ton by road. In 1829, there were 3,640 bushels of wheat transported down the canal from Buffalo. By 1837, this figure had increased to 500,000 bushels and, four years later, it reached one million. In nine years, tolls more than recouped the entire cost of construction. Within 15 years of the canal&#8217;s opening, New York was the busiest port in America, moving tonnages greater than Boston, Baltimore and New Orleans combined. Today, it can still be seen that every major city in New York State falls along the trade route established by the Erie Canal and nearly 80 per cent of upstate New York&#8217;s inhabitants live within 25 miles of the Erie Canal.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The completion of the Erie Canal spurred the first great westward movement of American settlers, gave access to the resources west of the Appalachians and made New York the preeminent commercial city in the United States. At one time, more than 50,000 people depended on the Erie Canal for their livelihood. From its inception, the Erie Canal helped form a whole new culture revolving around canal life. For those who travelled along the canal in packet boats or passenger vessels, the canal was an exciting place. Gambling and entertainment were frequent pastimes, and often families would meet each year at the same locations to share stories and adventures. Today, the canal has returned to its former glory and is filled with pleasure boats, fishermen, holidaymakers and cyclists riding the former towpaths where mules once trod. The excitement of the past is alive and well.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Story of Opium</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>Opium is a substance that is derived by collecting and later drying the milky juice that comes from the seed pods of the poppy plant. The substance can vary in colour and may be yellow or could range all the way to a very dark brown colour. Opium has a very bitter taste that is comparable to other plants from similar families and a distinct odour that is clearly identifiable. The primary component of opium is twelve per cent morphine, which is an alkaloid that is often processed chemically to produce illegal drugs, such as heroin. Codeine and other non-narcotic alkaloids are also found in the latex that is derived from the opium poppy plant.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>The history of opium dates back as far as the Neolithic and ancient times, when the drug was widely used in anaesthesia, as well as for ritualistic purposes. In ancient Egypt, opium was used as an analgesic and the Indians as well as the Romans both used opium during surgical procedures. Throughout the American Civil War, opium and various derivatives of opium were used. Morphine, opiods and synthetic opiates are all derived or come directly from the opium poppy, even in today&#8217;s medical use. While the medical world has evolved greatly and has manipulated opium to meet the needs of patients, the most raw form of opium, morphine, continues to be one of the most widely used analgesic drugs, even today.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>Opium use has many long- and short-term consequences that can be harmful to the body. Initially, the euphoric state that is caused by the drug can be relaxing and comforting, but long-term use of opium can lead to addiction and physical dependence. Many of the harmful consequences of using opium are related to the damage caused to the lungs from smoking the drug or to the consequences that are caused by derivatives of the drug. For many, the harmful consequences of opium will not present themselves until many years of use. However, for some, the effects of opium use are dangerous almost immediately and an overdose can lead to a risk of death.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div><span>Today, heroin&#8217;s long journey to final use begins with the planting of opium poppy seeds. Opium is grown mainly by impoverished farmers on small plots in remote regions of the world. It flourishes in dry, warm climates and the vast majority of opium poppies are grown in a narrow, 4,500-mile stretch of mountains extending across central Asia from Turkey through Pakistan and Burma. Recently, opium has been grown in Latin America, notably Colombia and Mexico. The farmer takes his crop of opium to the nearest village, where he will sell it to the dealer who offers him the best price.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph E</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>Legal growing of opium for medicinal use currently takes place in India, Turkey, and Australia. Two thousand tons of opium are produced annually and this supplies the world with the raw material needed to make medicinal products. Traditionally, opium was obtained from the latex of the poppy plant by scoring the seed pods by hand and allowing the latex to leak out and dry up. The sticky yellowish/brown residue is then scraped off and harvested for use. Today, modern methods of opium harvest include processing the mature poppy plant by machine in order to get the latex out of the flowering plant. Overall, opium production has changed very little over the years, however, selective breeding of the plant has led to an increase in the content of the phenanthrene alkaloids morphine, codeine and thebaine. Currently, there are three main sources for illegal opium: Burma, Afghanistan, and Colombia. Opium and heroin are ideal trade products: they are in great demand, are very profitable to produce, and the products take up little space. With modern transportation, opium and heroin can be moved from one country to another within days or a few weeks. Both drugs have a long and stable shelf life, allowing the products to be stored for long periods of time.</span><br></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph F</b></span></span></div><div><span>Opium was used for recreational purposes in China during the fifteenth century and on through the seventeenth century. It was nearly 300 years before the Chinese first realised that smoking opium was actually dangerous and could lead to physical dependence. In 1909, the International Opium Commission was formed to help regulate the shipping, sale and use of opium due to the dangers that were now widely known pertaining to the regular use of the drug. At this time, opium was first being purified into morphine and heroin, which are both highly potent drugs that have proved to be very much more dangerous than the raw opium itself. Recreational use of these drugs is now illegal in most countries around the world.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><span><b>Paragraph G</b></span></span></div><div><span><span>In the early days, people did not worry too much about the physical dependence that opium and its derivatives created. Today, the dangers are well recognised and there are a variety of ways to help people who have fallen victim to it. Most of the time, inpatient or residential treatment will be the basis for recovery. These programs will utilise counselling in both individual and group sessions to provide a foundation for success in recovery. Following the counselling in an inpatient treatment facility, those in recovery will continue treatment in an outpatient facility that provides similar counselling and therapy in a less supervised environment.</span><br></span></div>",

          "content": "<b>Video Games and Violence</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>For quite some time now, video games that involve significant amounts of violence have been blamed for growing numbers of violence by young people, the demographic most likely to play these games. Debate about this has even reached the courts, with both sides of the argument claiming that the scientific literature supports their opinions. Some experts involved have proclaimed that the debate is scientifically settled and that only people holding personal concerns and biases oppose these established truths. Scientifically, two competing social theories have been formulated about the potential effects of video game violence. The first is that video games increase violence because they teach players how to be violent and reinforce violent tendencies. The second theory is that video games have a possibly beneficial effect, because they provide a socially acceptable outlet for the release of aggression and thereby promote better mental health.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Articles reviewing the effects of video games on general populations have found links between playing violent video games and changes in behaviour, and/or thought process, with some finding that people who played realistic violent games for 45 minutes had a greater increase in violent and aggressive feelings than persons who played unrealistic violent video games or non-violent video games for the same period. What seems clear though is that certain populations are more at risk and/or are more likely to play violent video games than others. Studies suggest that at-risk individuals are usually male, have pre-existing personality disorders or traits, for example a conduct disorder, have pre-existing mental health conditions, have had difficult or traumatic upbringings, and are insecure with poor selfesteem. Children with attention deficit disorder were also seen to be at a higher risk of showing addictive behaviour to violent video games and that violent video games might be a significant risk variable for aggressive behaviour in persons who already have aggressive personality traits. There are, of course, plenty of other groups of people (probably the majority of users) who play and enjoy video games, with or without violence, that have no character disorders at all. Another recent key report which relied on parents&#8217; self-report of their children&#8217;s video game&#8211;playing behaviours suggests that spending a large amount of time playing violent video games was correlated with troublesome behaviour and poor academic achievement. The same study also indicated that children who played more educational games had more positive outcomes.<br></div><div><br></div><div>What is interesting is that the comic book debate of the 1950&#8217;s is eerily similar when compared to the current debate about the effects of video games on children. In 1954, the US Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency held hearings on the effects of comic books on America&#8217;s youth. The primary focus of the Senate hearings was &#8216;crime and horror&#8217; comic books, some of which graphically showed horrific images, such as dismembered bodies. Concerns were voiced that these comics would lead to a decline in public morals, an increase in violence and aggression, an increase in general lawlessness, and societal disrespect and deterioration. Medical and social science experts became involved in the debate, writing articles in reputable journals. Many of the concerns that dominate the current video game debate were also expressed and it could show the frequently experienced perception that violent behaviour is always more prevalent in the present than in the past and that people just search for a scapegoat on which to blame it.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Although many articles have suggested a connection between violent video games and aggression, several studies have found no such relationship. One study in fact showed that non-gamers and excessive gamers both had lower self-reported mental wellness scores than low to moderate gamers. This finding suggests that excessive playing may be detrimental, but that there are some protective and non-harmful consequences to playing in moderation. This finding is in line with social theory, which suggests that video games, like sports, may provide an outlet for individuals to work through aggression and, therefore, have better mental functioning and overall lower levels of aggression. The same study pointed to the positive attributes of violent video game playing, such as improved visualspatial coordination, increased peripheral attention, and increased decision-making capabilities. People who play a lot of video games also generally have better overall computer skills than people who do not.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another study examining the multivariate risk issues for youth violence showed that the most common positive predictors of youth violence were delinquent peer influences, antisocial personality traits, depression, and parents or guardians who use psychological abuse in family relationships. The factors that were not found to be predictive of youth violence included how nice a neighbourhood the youth lived in, parental use of domestic physical violence in intimate relationships, and exposure to violent television or video games.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A recent neurological study provided further evidence that video games do not increase violent behaviour by users. The study examined whether there was a change in brain imaging that suggested a loss of distinction between virtual and actual violence in players of violent video games compared with controls. What was found was that the ability to differentiate automatically between real and virtual violence was not diminished by a long-term history of violent video game play, and nor were gamers&#8217; neural responses to real violence subject to desensitisation processes. This would indicate that video games do not cause people to lose their grip on what is real in comparison with what is fantasy.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Many questions are raised by the split nature of the scientific literature regarding violence and video games and it should also be remembered that a correlation does not prove a causation. Stakeholders need to examine the current video game debate in order to decide how to sensibly influence social policy.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>How tennis rackets have changed</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>In 2016, the British professional tennis player Andy Murray was ranked as the world's number one. It was an incredible achievement by any standard - made even more remarkable by the fact that he did this during a period considered to be one of the strongest in the sport's history, competing against the likes of Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, to name just a few. Yet five years previously, he had been regarded as a talented outsider who entered but never won the major tournaments.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Of the changes that account for this transformation, one was visible and widely publicised: in 2011, Murray invited former number one player Ivan Lendl onto his coaching team - a valuable addition that had a visible impact on the player's playing style. Another change was so subtle as to pass more or less unnoticed. Like many players, Murray has long preferred a racket that consists of two types of string: one for the mains (verticals) and another for the crosses (horizontals). While he continued to use natural string in the crosses, in 2012 he switched to a synthetic string for the mains. A small change, perhaps, but its importance should not be underestimated.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The modification that Murray made is just one of a number of options available to players looking to tweak their rackets in order to improve their games. 'Touring professionals have their rackets customised to their specific needs,' says Colin Triplow, a UK-based professional racket stringer. 'It's a highly important part of performance maximisation.' Consequently, the specific rackets used by the world's elite are not actually readily available to the public; rather, each racket is individually made to suit the player who uses it. Take the US professional tennis players Mike and Bob Bryan, for example: 'We're very particular with our racket specifications,' they say. 'All our rackets are sent from our manufacturer to Tampa, Florida, where our frames go through a... thorough customisation process.' They explain how they have adjusted not only racket length, but even experimented with different kinds of paint. The rackets they use now weigh more than the average model and also have a denser string pattern (i.e. more crosses and mains).<br></div><div><br></div><div>The primary reason for these modifications is simple: as the line between winning and losing becomes thinner and thinner, even these slight changes become more and more important. As a result, players and their teams are becoming increasingly creative with the modifications to their rackets as they look to maximise their competitive advantage.<br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Racket modifications mainly date back to the 1970s, when the amateur German tennis player Werner Fischer started playing with the so-called spaghetti-strung racket. It created a string bed that generated so much topspin that it was quickly banned by the International Tennis Federation. However, within a decade or two, racket modification became a regularity. Today it is, in many ways, an aspect of the game that is equal in significance to nutrition or training.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Modifications can be divided into two categories: those to the string bed and those to the racket frame. The former is far more common than the latter: the choice of the strings and the tension with which they are installed is something that nearly all professional players experiment with. They will continually change it depending on various factors including the court surface, climatic conditions, and game styles. Some will even change it depending on how they feel at the time.<br></span></div><div><br></div><div>At one time, all tennis rackets were strung with natural gut made from the outer layer of sheep or cow intestines. This all changed in the early 1990s with the development of synthetic strings that were cheaper and more durable. They are made from three materials: nylon (relatively durable and affordable), Kevlar (too stiff to be used alone) or co-polyester (polyester combined with additives that enhance its performance). Even so, many professional players continue to use a 'hybrid set-up', where a combination of both synthetic and natural strings are used.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Of the synthetics, co-polyester is by far the most widely used. It's a perfect fit for the style of tennis now played, where players tend to battle it out from the back of the court rather than coming to the net. Studies indicate that the average spin from a co-polyester string is 25% greater than that from natural string or other synthetics. In a sense, the development of co-polyester strings has revolutionised the game.<br></div><div><br></div><div>However, many players go beyond these basic adjustments to the strings and make changes to the racket frame itself. For example, much of the serving power of US professional player Pete Sampras was attributed to the addition of four to five lead weights onto his rackets, and today many professionals have the weight adjusted during the manufacturing process.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Other changes to the frame involve the handle. Players have individual preferences for the shape of the handle and some will have the handle of one racket moulded onto the frame of a different racket. Other players make different changes. The professional Portuguese player Gon&#231;alo Oliveira replaced the original grips of his rackets with something thinner because they had previously felt uncomfortable to hold.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Racket customisation and modification have pushed the standards of the game to greater levels that few could have anticipated in the days of natural strings and heavy, wooden frames, and it's exciting to see what further developments there will be in the future.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The pirates of the ancient Mediterranean</b><div><b><i><br></i></b></div><div><i>In the first and second millennia BCE, pirates sailed around the Mediterranean, attacking ships and avoiding pursuers</i><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>A</b></div><div>When one mentions pirates, an image springs to most people's minds of a crew of misfits, daredevils and adventurers in command of a tall sailing ship in the Caribbean Sea. Yet from the first to the third millennium BCE, thousands of years before these swashbucklers began spreading fear across the Caribbean, pirates prowled the Mediterranean, raiding merchant ships and threatening vital trade routes. However, despite all efforts and the might of various ancient states, piracy could not be stopped. The situation remained unchanged for thousands of years. Only when the pirates directly threatened the interests of ancient Rome did the Roman Republic organise a massive fleet to eliminate piracy. Under the command of the Roman general Pompey, Rome eradicated piracy, transforming the Mediterranean into 'Mare Nostrum' (Our Sea).<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>Although piracy in the Mediterranean is first recorded in ancient Egypt during the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep III (c 1390-1353 BCE), it is reasonable to assume it predated this powerful civilisation. This is partly due to the great importance the Mediterranean held at this time, and partly due to its geography. While the Mediterranean region is predominantly fertile, some parts are rugged and hilly, even mountainous. In the ancient times, the inhabitants of these areas relied heavily on marine resources, including fish and salt. Most had their own boats, possessed good seafaring skills, and unsurpassed knowledge of the local coastline and sailing routes. Thus, it is not surprising that during hardships, these men turned to piracy. Geography itself further benefited the pirates, with the numerous coves along the coast providing places for them to hide their boats and strike undetected. Before the invention of ocean-going caravels&#34; in the 15th century, ships could not easily cross long distances over open water. Thus, in the ancient world most were restricted to a few well- known navigable routes that followed the coastline. Caught in a trap, a slow merchant ship laden with goods had no other option but to surrender. In addition, knowledge of the local area helped the pirates to avoid retaliation once a state fleet arrived.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>* caravel: a small, highly manoeuvrable sailing ship developed by the Portuguese</i><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>One should also add that it was not unknown in the first and second millennia BCE for governments to resort to pirates' services, especially during wartime, employing their skills and numbers against their opponents. A pirate fleet would serve in the first wave of attack, preparing the way for the navy. Some of the regions were known for providing safe harbours to pirates, who, in return, boosted the local economy.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>The first known record of a named group of Mediterranean pirates, made during the rule of ancient Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten (c 1353-1336 BCE), was in the Amarna Letters. These were extracts of diplomatic correspondence between the pharaoh and his allies, and covered many pressing issues, including piracy. It seems the pharaoh was troubled by two distinct pirate groups, the Lukka and the Sherden. Despite the Egyptian fleet's best efforts, the pirates continued to cause substantial disruption to regional commerce. In the letters, the king of Alashiya (modern Cyprus) rejected Akhenaten's claims of a connection with the Lukka (based in modern-day Turkey). The king assured Akhenaten he was prepared to punish any of his subjects involved in piracy.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>The ancient Greek world's experience of piracy was different from that of Egyptian rulers. While Egypt's power was land-based, the ancient Greeks relied on the Mediterranean in almost all aspects of life, from trade to warfare. Interestingly, in his works the Iliad and the Odyssey, the ancient Greek writer Homer not only condones, but praises the lifestyle and actions of pirates. The opinion remained unchanged in the following centuries. The ancient Greek historian Thucydides, for instance, glorified pirates' daring attacks on ships or even cities. For Greeks, piracy was a part of everyday life. Even high-ranking members of the state were not beyond engaging in such activities. According to the Greek orator Demosthenes, in 355 BCE, Athenian ambassadors made a detour from their official travel to capture a ship sailing from Egypt, taking the wealth found onboard for themselves! The Greeks' liberal approach towards piracy does not mean they always tolerated it, but attempts to curtail piracy were hampered by the large number of pirates operating in the Mediterranean.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>The rising power of ancient Rome required the Roman Republic to deal with piracy in the Mediterranean. While piracy was a serious issue for the Republic, Rome profited greatly from its existence. Pirate raids provided a steady source of slaves, essential for Rome's agriculture and mining industries. But this arrangement could work only while the pirates left Roman interests alone. Pirate attacks on grain ships, which were essential to Roman citizens, led to angry voices in the Senate, demanding punishment of the culprits. Rome, however, did nothing, further encouraging piracy. By the 1st century BCE, emboldened pirates kidnapped prominent Roman dignitaries, asking for a large ransom to be paid. Their most famous hostage was none other than Julius Caesar, captured in 75 BCE.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>G</b></div><div>By now, Rome was well aware that pirates had outlived their usefulness. The time had come for concerted action. In 67 BCE, a new law granted Pompey vast funds to combat the Mediterranean menace. Taking personal command, Pompey divided the entire Mediterranean into 13 districts, assigning a fleet and commander to each. After cleansing one district of pirates, the fleet would join another in the next district. The process continued until the entire Mediterranean was free of pirates. Although thousands of pirates died at the hands of Pompey's troops, as a long-term solution to the problem, many more were offered land in fertile areas located far from the sea. Instead of a maritime menace, Rome got productive farmers that further boosted its economy.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The persistence and peril of misinformation</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><i>Brian Southwell looks at how human brains verify information and discusses some of the challenges of battling widespread falsehoods</i><br></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>Misinformation &#8212; both deliberately promoted and accidentally shared &#8212; is perhaps an inevitable part of the world in which we live, but it is not a new problem. People likely have lied to one another for roughly as long as verbal communication has existed. Deceiving others can offer an apparent opportunity to gain strategic advantage, to motivate others to action, or even to protect interpersonal bonds. Moreover, people inadvertently have been sharing inaccurate information with one another for thousands of years.<br></div><div><br></div><div>However, we currently live in an era in which technology enables information to reach large audiences distributed across the globe, and thus the potential for immediate and widespread effects from misinformation now looms larger than in the past. Yet the means to correct misinformation might, over time, be found in those same patterns of mass communication and of the facilitated spread of information.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The main worry regarding misinformation is its potential to unduly influence attitudes and behavior, leading people to think and act differently than they would if they were correctly informed, as suggested by the research teams of Stephan Lewandowsky of the University of Bristol and Elizabeth Marsh of Duke University, among others. In other words, we worry that misinformation might lead people to hold misperceptions (or false beliefs) and that these misperceptions, especially when they occur among large groups of people, may have detrimental, downstream consequences for health, social harmony, and the political climate.<br></div><div><br></div><div>At least three observations related to misinformation in the contemporary mass-media environment warrant the attention of researchers, policy makers, and really everyone who watches television, listens to the radio, or reads information online. First of all, people who encounter misinformation tend to believe it, at least initially. Secondly, electronic and print media often do not block many types of misinformation before it appears in content available to large audiences. Thirdly, countering misinformation once it has enjoyed wide exposure can be a resource-intensive effort.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Knowing what happens when people initially encounter misinformation holds tremendous importance for estimating the potential for subsequent problems. Although it is fairly routine for individuals to come across information that is false, the question of exactly how &#8212; and when &#8212; we mentally label information as true or false has garnered philosophical debate. The dilemma is neatly summarized by a contrast between how the 17th-century philosophers Ren&#233; Descartes and Baruch Spinoza described human information engagement, with conflicting predictions that only&#160;recently have been empirically tested in robust ways. Descartes argued that a person only accepts or rejects information after considering its truth or falsehood; Spinoza argued that people accept all encountered information (or misinformation) by default and then subsequently verify or reject it through a separate cognitive process. In recent decades, empirical evidence from the research teams of Erik Asp of the University of Chicago and Daniel Gilbert at Harvard University, among others, has supported Spinoza&#8217;s account: people appear to encode all new information as if it were true, even if only momentarily, and later tag the information as being either true or false, a pattern that seems consistent with the observation that mental resources for skepticism physically reside in a different part of the brain than the resources used in perceiving and encoding.<br></div><div><br></div><div>What about our second observation that misinformation often can appear in electronic or print media without being preemptively blocked? In support of this, one might consider the nature of regulatory structures in the United States: regulatory agencies here tend to focus on post hoc detection of broadcast information. Organizations such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) offer considerable monitoring and notification functions, but these roles typically do not involve preemptive censoring. The FDA oversees direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising, for example, and has developed mechanisms such as the &#8216;Bad Ad&#8217; program, through which people can report advertising in apparent violation of FDA guidelines on drug risks. Such programs, although laudable and useful, do not keep false advertising off the airwaves. In addition, even misinformation that is successfully corrected can continue to affect attitudes,<br></div><div><br></div><div>This leads us to our third observation: a campaign to correct misinformation, even if rhetorically compelling, requires resources and planning to accomplish necessary reach and frequency. For corrective campaigns to be persuasive, audiences need to be able to comprehend them, which requires either effort to frame messages in ways that are accessible or effort to educate and sensitize audiences to the possibility of misinformation, That some audiences might be unaware of the potential for misinformation also suggests the utility of media literacy efforts as early as elementary school. Even with journalists and scholars pointing to the phenomenon of &#8216;fake news&#8217;, people do not distinguish between demonstrably false stories and those based in fact when scanning and processing written information.<br></div><div><br></div><div>We live at a time when widespread misinformation is common. Yet at this time many people also are passionately developing potential solutions and remedies. The journey forward undoubtedly will be a long and arduous one. Future remedies will require not only continued theoretical consideration but also the development and maintenance of consistent monitoring tools &#8212; and a recognition among fellow members of society that claims which find prominence in the media that are insufficiently based in scientific consensus and social reality should be countered, Misinformation arises as a result of human fallibility and human information needs. To overcome the worst effects of the phenomenon, we will need coordinated efforts over time, rather than any singular one-time panacea we could hope to offer.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Industrial Revolution in Britain</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the mid-1700s and by the 1830s and 1840s had spread to many other parts of the world, including the United States. In Britain, it was a period when a largely rural, agrarian&#8221; society was transformed into an industrialised, urban one. Goods that had once been crafted by hand started to be produced in mass quantities by machines in factories, thanks to the invention of steam power and the introduction of new machines and manufacturing techniques in textiles, iron-making and other industries.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The foundations of the Industrial Revolution date back to the early 1700s, when the English inventor Thomas Newcomen designed the first modern steam engine. Called the &#8216;atmospheric steam engine&#8217;, Newcomen&#8217;s invention was originally used to power machines that pumped water out of mines. In the 1760s, the Scottish engineer James Watt started to adapt one of Newcomen&#8217;s models, and succeeded in making it far more efficient. Watt later worked with the English manufacturer Matthew Boulton to invent a new steam engine driven by both the forward and backward strokes of the piston, while the gear mechanism it was connected to produced rotary motion. It was a key innovation that would allow steam power to spread across British industries.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The demand for coal, which was a relatively cheap energy source, grew rapidly during the Industrial Revolution, as it was needed to run not only the factories used to produce manufactured goods, but also steam-powered transportation. In the early 1800s, the English engineer Richard Trevithick built a steam-powered locomotive, and by 1830 goods and passengers were being transported between the industrial centres of Manchester and Liverpool. In addition, steam-powered boats and ships were widely used to carry goods along Britain&#8217;s canals as well as across the Atlantic.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Britain had produced textiles like wool, linen and cotton, for hundreds of years, but prior to the Industrial Revolution, the British textile business was a true &#8216;cottage industry&#8217;, with the work performed in small workshops or even homes by individual spinners, weavers and dyers. Starting in the mid-1700s, innovations like the spinning jenny and the power loom made weaving cloth and spinning yarn and thread much easier. With these machines, relatively little labour was required to produce cloth, and the new, mechanised textile factories that opened around the country were quickly able to meet customer demand for cloth both at home and abroad.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>* agrarian: relating to the and, especially the use of land for farming</i><br></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>The British iron industry also underwent major change as it adopted new innovations. Chief among the new techniques was the smelting of iron ore with coke (a material made by heating coal) instead of the traditional charcoal. This method was cheaper and produced metals that were of a higher quality, enabling Britain's iron and steel production to expand in response to demand created by the Napoleonic Wars (1803-15) and the expansion of the railways from the 1830s.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The latter part of the Industrial Revolution also saw key advances in communication methods, as people increasingly saw the need to communicate efficiently over long distances. In 1837, British inventors William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone patented the first commercial telegraphy system. In the 1830s and 1840s, Samuel Morse and other inventors worked on their own versions in the United States. Cooke and Wheatstone's system was soon used for railway signalling in the UK. As the speed of the new locomotives increased, it was essential to have a fast and effective means of avoiding collisions.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The impact of the Industrial Revolution on people&#8217;s lives was immense. Although many people in Britain had begun moving to the cities from rural areas before the Industrial Revolution, this accelerated dramatically with industrialisation, as the rise of large factories turned smaller towns into major cities in just a few decades. This rapid urbanisation brought significant challenges, as overcrowded cities suffered from pollution and inadequate sanitation.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Although industrialisation increased the country&#8217;s economic output overall and improved the standard of living for the middle and upper classes, many poor people continued to struggle. Factory workers had to work long hours in dangerous conditions for extremely low wages. These conditions along with the rapid pace of change fuelled opposition to industrialisation. A group of British workers who became known as &#8216;Luddites&#8217; were British weavers and textile workers who objected to the increased use of mechanised looms and knitting frames. Many had spent years learning their craft, and they feared that unskilled machine operators were robbing them of their livelihood. A few desperate weavers began breaking into factories and smashing textile machines. They called themselves Luddites after Ned Ludd, a young apprentice who was rumoured to have wrecked a textile machine in 1779.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The first major instances of machine breaking took place in 1811 in the city of Nottingham, and the practice soon spread across the country. Machine-breaking Luddites attacked and burned factories, and in some cases they even exchanged gunfire with company guards and soldiers. The workers wanted employers to stop installing new machinery, but the British government responded to the uprisings by making machine-breaking punishable by death. The unrest finally reached its peak in April 1812, when a few Luddites were shot during an attack on a mill near Huddersfield. In the days that followed, other Luddites were arrested, and dozens were hanged or transported to Australia. By 1813, the Luddite resistance had all but vanished.<br></div>",

This is something that British tennis player Emma Raducanu wrote about on social media following her withdrawal from the 2021 Wimbledon tournament. Though the young player had been doing well in the tournament, she began having difficully regulating her breathing and heart rate during a match, which she later attributed to &#8216;the accumulation of the excitement and the buzz&#8217;.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>For athletes, some level of performance stress is almost unavoidable. But there are many different factors that dictate just how people&#8217;s minds and bodies respond to stressful events. Typically, stress is the result of an exchange between two factors: demands and resources. An athlete may feel stressed about an event if they feel the demands on them are greater than they can handle. These demands include the high level of physical and mental effort required to succeed, and also the athlete&#8217;s concerns about the difficulty of the event, their chance of succeeding, and any potential dangers such as injury. Resources, on the other hand, are a person's ability to cope with these demands. These include factors such as the competitor's degree of confidence, how much they believe they can control the situation&#8217;s outcome, and whether they're looking forward to the event or not.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>Each new demand or change in circumstances affects whether a person responds positively or negatively to stress. Typically, the more resources a person feels they have in handling the situation, the more positive their stress response. This positive stress response is called a challenge state. But should the person feel there are too many demands placed on them, the more likely they are to experience a negative stress response &#8212; known as a threat state. Research shows that the challenge states lead to good performance, while threat states lead to poorer performance. So, in Emma Raducanu&#8217;s case, a much larger audience, higher expectations and facing a more skilful opponent, may all have led her to feel there were greater demands being placed on her at Wimbledon &#8212; but she didn't have the resources to tackle them. This led to her experiencing a threat response.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>Our challenge and threat responses essentially influence how our body responds to stressful situations, as both affect the production of adrenaline and cortisol &#8212; also known as &#8216;stress hormones&#8217;. During a challenge state, adrenaline increases the amount of blood pumped from the heart and expands the blood vessels, which allows more energy to be delivered to the muscles and brain. This increase of blood and decrease of pressure in the blood vessels has been consistently related to superior sport performance in everything from cricket batting, to golf putting and&#160;football penalty taking. But during a threat state, cortisol inhibits the positive effect of adrenaline, resulting in tighter blood vessels, higher blood pressure, slower psychological responses, and a faster heart rate. In short, a threat state makes people more anxious &#8212; they make worse decisions and perform more poorly. In tennis players, cortisol has been associated with more unsuccessful serves and greater anxiety.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>That said, anxiety is also a common experience for athletes when they're under pressure. Anxiety can increase heart rate and perspiration, cause heart palpitations, muscle tremors and shortness of breath, as well as headaches, nausea, stomach pain, weakness and a desire to escape in more extreme cases. Anxiety can also reduce concentration and self-control and cause overthinking. The intensity with which a person experiences anxiety depends on the demands and resources they have. Anxiety may also manifest itself in the form of excitement or nervousness depending on the stress response. Negative stress responses can be damaging to both physical and mental health &#8212; and repeated episodes of anxiety coupled with negative responses can increase risk of heart disease and depression.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>But there are many ways athletes can ensure they respond positively under pressure. Positive stress responses can be promoted through the language that they and others &#8212; such as coaches or parents &#8212; use. Psychologists can also help athletes change how they see their physiological responses &#8212; such as helping them see a higher heart rate as excitement, rather than nerves. Developing psychological skills, such as visualisation, can also help decrease physiological responses to threat. Visualisation may involve the athlete recreating a mental picture of a time when they performed well, or picturing themselves doing well in the future. This can help create a feeling of control over the stressful event. Recreating competitive pressure during training can also help athletes learn how to deal with stress. An example of this might be scoring athletes against their peers to create a sense of competition. This would increase the demands which players experience compared to a normal training session, while still allowing them to practise coping with stress.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>An inquiry into the existence of the gifted child</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Let us start by looking at a modern &#8216;genius&#8217;, Maryam Mirzakhani, who died at the early age of 40. She was the only woman to win the Fields Medal &#8212; the mathematical equivalent of a Nobel prize. It would be easy to assume that someone as special as Mirzakhani must have been one of those &#8216;gifted&#8217; children, those who have an extraordinary ability in a specific sphere of activity or knowledge. But look closer and a different story emerges. Mirzakhani was born in Tehran, Iran, She went to a highly selective girls&#8221; school but maths wasn&#8217;t her interest &#8212; reading was. She loved novels and would read anything she could lay her hands on. As for maths, she did rather poorly at it for the first couple of years in her middle school, but became interested when her elder brother told her about what he&#8217;d learned. He shared a famous maths problem from a magazine that fascinated her &#8212; and she was hooked.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In adult life it is clear that she was curious, excited by what she did and also resolute in the face of setbacks. One of her comments sums it up. &#8216;Of course, the most rewarding part is the &#8220;Aha&#8221; moment, the excitement of discovery and enjoyment of understanding something new .. . But most of the time, doing mathematics for me is like being on a long hike with no trail and no end in sight.&#8217; That trail took her to the heights of original research into mathematics.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Is her background unusual? Apparently not. Most Nobel prize winners were unexceptional&#160;in childhood. Einstein was slow to talk as a baby. He failed the general part of the entry test to Zurich Polytechnic &#8212; though they let him in because of high physics and maths scores. He struggled at work initially, but he kept plugging away and eventually rewrote the laws of Newtonian mechanics with his theory of relativity.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There has been a considerable amount of research on high performance over the last century that suggests it goes way beyond tested intelligence. On top of that, research is clear that brains are flexible, new neural pathways can be created, and IQ isn&#8217;t fixed. For example, just because you can read stories with hundreds of pages at the age of five doesn&#8217;t mean you will still be ahead of your contemporaries in your teens.<br></div><div><br></div><div>While the jury is out on giftedness being innate and other factors potentially making the difference, what is certain is that the behaviours associated with high levels of performance are replicable and most can be taught &#8212; even traits such as curiosity.<br></div><div><br></div><div>According to my colleague Prof Deborah Eyre, with whom I&#8217;ve collaborated on the book Great Minds and How to Grow Them, the latest neuroscience and psychological research suggests most individuals can reach levels of performance associated in school with the gifted and talented. However, they must be taught the right attitudes and approaches to their learning and develop the attributes of high performers &#8212; curiosity, persistence and hard work, for example &#8212; an approach Eyre calls &#8216;high performance learning&#8217;. Critically, they need the right support in developing those approaches at home as well as at school.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Prof Anders Ericsson, an eminent education psychologist at Florida State University, US, is the co-author of Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise. After research going back to 1980 into diverse achievements, from music to memory to sport, he doesn&#8217;t think unique and innate talents are at the heart of performance. Deliberate practice, that stretches you every step of the way, and around 10,000 hours of it, is what produces the goods. It&#8217;s not a magic number &#8212; the highest performers move on to doing a whole lot more, of course. Ericsson&#8217;s memory research is particularly interesting because random students, trained in memory techniques for the study, went on to outperform others thought to have innately superior memories &#8212; those who you might call gifted.<br></div><div><br></div><div>But it is perhaps the work of Benjamin Bloom, another distinguished American educationist working in the 1980s, that gives the most pause for thought. Bloom&#8217;s team looked at a group of extraordinarily high achieving people in disciplines as varied as ballet, swimming, piano, tennis, maths, sculpture and neurology. He found a pattern of parents encouraging and supporting their children, often in areas&#160;they enjoyed themselves, Bloom&#8217;s outstanding people had worked very hard and consistently at something they had become hooked on when at a young age, and their parents all emerged as having strong work ethics themselves.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Eyre says we know how high performers learn. From that she has developed a high performing learning approach. She is working on this with a group of schools, both in Britain and abroad. Some spin-off research, which looked in detail at 24 of the 3,000 children being studied who were succeeding despite difficult circumstances, found something remarkable. Half were getting free school meals because of poverty, more than half were living with a single parent, and four in five were living in disadvantaged areas. Interviews uncovered strong evidence of an adult or adults in the child&#8217;s life who valued and supported education, either in the immediate or extended family or in the child&#8217;s wider community. Children talked about the need to work hard at school, to listen in class and keep trying.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Let us end with Einstein, the epitome of a genius. He clearly had curiosity, character and determination. He struggled against rejection in early life but was undeterred. Did he think he was a genius or even gifted? He once wrote: &#8216;Its not that I&#8217;m so smart, it&#8217;s just that I stay with problems longer. Most people say it is the intellect which makes a great scientist. They are wrong: it is character.&#8217;<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Archaeologists discover evidence of prehistoric island settlers</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>In early April 2019, Dr Ceri Shipton and his colleagues from Australian National University became the first archaeologists to explore Obi, one of many tropical islands in Indonesia&#8217;s Maluku Utara province. The research team's discoveries suggest that the prehistoric people who lived on Obi were adept on both land and sea, hunting in the dense rainforest, foraging on the seashore, and possibly even voyaging between islands.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The excavations were part of a project to learn more about how people first dispersed from mainland Asia, through the Indonesian archipelago and into the prehistoric continent that once connected Australia and New Guinea. The team&#8217;s earlier research suggested that the northernmost islands in the group, known as the Wallacean islands, including Obi, would have offered the easiest migration route. It also seemed likely that these islands were crucial &#8216;stepping stones&#8217; on humans&#8217; island-hopping voyages through this region millennia ago. But to support this idea, they needed archaeological evidence for humans living in this remote area in the ancient past. So, they travelled to Obi to look for sites that might reveal evidence of early occupation.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Just inland from the village of Kelo on Obi&#8217;s northern coast, Shipton and his colleagues found two caves containing prehistoric rock shelters that were suitable for excavation. With the permission and help of the local people of Kelo, they dug a small test excavation in each shelter. There they found numerous artefacts, including fragments of axes, some dating to about 14,000 years ago. The earliest axes at Kelo were made using clam shells. Axes made from clam shells from roughly the same time had also previously been found elsewhere in this region, including on the nearby island of Gebe to the northeast. As on Gebe, it is highly likely that Obi&#8217;s axes were used in the construction of canoes, thus allowing these early peoples to maintain connections between communities on neighbouring islands.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The oldest cultural layers from the Kelo site provided the team with the earliest record for human occupation on Obi, dating back around 18,000 years. At this time the climate was drier and colder than today, and the island's dense rainforests would likely have been much less impenetrable than they are now. Sea levels were about 120 metres lower, meaning Obi was a much larger island, encompassing what is today the separate island of Bisa, as well as several other small islands nearby.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Roughly 11,700 years ago, as the most recent ice age ended, the climate became significantly warmer and wetter, no doubt making Obi&#8217;s jungle much thicker. According to the researchers, it is no coincidence that around this time the first axes crafted from stone rather than sea shells appear, likely in response to their heavy-duty use for clearing and modification of the increasingly dense rainforest. While stone takes about twice as long to grind into an axe compared to shell, the harder material keeps its sharp edge for longer.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Judging by the bones which the researchers unearthed in the Kelo caves, people living there mainly hunted the Rothschild&#8217;s cuscus, a possum-like creature that still lives on Obi today. As the forest grew more dense, people probably used axes to clear patches of forest and make hunting easier.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Shipton&#8217;s team&#8217;s excavation of the shelters at the Kelo site unearthed a volcanic glass substance called obsidian, which must have been brought over from another island, as there is no known source on Obi. It also revealed particular types of beads, similar to those previously found on islands in southern Wallacea. These finds again support the idea that Obi islanders routinely travelled to other islands.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The excavations suggest people successfully lived in the two Kelo shelters for about 10,000 years. But then, about 8,000 years ago, both were abandoned. Did the residents leave Obi completely, or move elsewhere on the island? Perhaps the jungle had grown so thick that axes were no longer a match for the dense undergrowth. Perhaps people simply moved to the coast and turned to fishing rather than hunting as a means of survival.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Whatever the reason for the departure, there is no evidence for use of the Kelo shelters after this time, until about 1,000 years ago, when they were re-occupied by people who owned pottery as well as items made out of gold and silver. It seems likely, in view of Obi&#8217;s location, that this final phase of occupation also saw the Kelo shelters used by people involved in the historic trade in spices between the Maluku islands and the rest of the world.<br></div>",

These are complex ecosystems, rich in unique plant and animal life. But according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWEN), half of the world&#8217;s wetlands have disappeared since 1990 &#8212; converted or destroyed for commercial development, drainage schemes and the extraction of minerals and peat&#8217;. Many of those that remain have been damaged by agricultural pesticides and fertilisers, industrial pollutants, and construction works.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>Throughout history, humans have gathered around wetlands, and their fertile ecosystems have played an important part in human development. Consequently, they are of considerable religious, historical and archaeological value to many communities around the world. &#8216;Wetlands directly support the livelihoods and well-being of millions of people,&#8217; says Dr Matthew McCartney, principal researcher and hydrologist at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI). &#8216;In many developing countries, large numbers of people are dependent on wetland agriculture for their livelihoods.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>They also serve a crucial environmental purpose. &#8216;Wetlands are one of the key tools in mitigating climate change across the planet,&#8217; says Pieter van Eijk, head of Climate Adaptation at Wetlands International (WI), pointing to their use as buffers that protect coastal areas from sea-level rise and extreme weather events such as hurricanes and flooding. Wetland coastal forests provide food and water, as well as shelter from storms, and WI and other agencies are working to restore those forests which have been lost. &#8216;It can be as simple as planting a few trees per hectare to create shade and substantially change a microclimate,&#8217; he says. &#8216;Implementing climate change projects isn&#8217;t so much about money.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>The world&#8217;s wetlands are, unfortunately, rich sources for in-demand commodities, such as palm oil and pulpwood. Peatlands &#8212; wetlands with a waterlogged organic soil layer &#8212; are particularly targeted. When peatlands are drained for cultivation, they become net carbon emitters instead of active carbon stores, and, according to Marcel Silvius, head of Climatesmart Land-use at WI, this practice causes six per cent of all global carbon emissions. The clearance of peatlands for planting also increases the risk of forest fires, which release huge amounts of CO, &#8216;We&#8217;re secing huge peatland forests with extremely high biodiversity value being lost for a few decades of oil palm revenues,&#8217; says Silvius.<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>*peat: a brown deposit formed by the partial decomposition of vegetation in wet acidic conditions, often cut out and dried for use as fuel</i><br></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>The damage starts when logging companies arrive to clear the trees. They dig ditches to enter the peat swamps by boat and then float the logs out the same way. These are then used to drain water out of the peatlands to allow for the planting of corn, oil palms or pulpwood trees. Once the water has drained away, bacteria and fungi then break down the carbon in the peat and turn it into CO2 and methane. Meanwhile, the remainder of the solid matter in the peat starts to move downwards, in a process known as subsidence&#8217; &#8217;, Peat comprises 90 per cent water, so this is one of the most alarming consequences of peatland clearances. &#8216;In the tropics, peat subsides at about four centimetres a year, so within half a century, very large landscapes on Sumatra and Borneo will become flooded as the peat drops below water level,&#8217; says Silvius. &#8216;It&#8217;s a huge catastrophe that&#8217;s in preparation. Some provinces will lose 40 per cent of their landmass.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>And while these industries affect wetlands in ways that can easily be documented, Dr Dave Tickner of the WWEN believes that more subtle impacts can be even more devastating. &#8216;Sediment run-off and fertilisers can be pretty invisible,&#8217; says Tickner. &#8216;Over-extraction of water is equally invisible. You do get shock stories about rivers running red, or even catching fire, but there&#8217;s seldom one big impact that really hurts a wetland.&#8217; Tickner does not blame anyone for deliberate damage, however. &#8216;I&#8217;ve worked on wetland issues for 20 years and have never met anybody who wanted to damage a wetland,&#8217; he says. &#8216;It isn&#8217;t something that people generally set out to do. Quite often, the effects simply come from people trying to make a living.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>G</b></div><div>Silvius also acknowledges the importance of income generation. &#8216;It&#8217;s not that we just want to restore the biodiversity of wetlands &#8212; which we do &#8212; but we recognise there&#8217;s a need to provide an income for local people.&#8217; This approach is supported by IWMI. &#8216;The idea is that people in a developing country will only protect wetlands if they value and profit from them,&#8217; says McCartney. &#8216;For sustainability, it&#8217;s essential that local people are involved in wetland planning and decision making and have clear rights to use wetlands.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>H</b></div><div>The fortunes of wetlands would be improved, Silvius suggests, if more governments recognised their long-term value. &#8216;Different governments have different attitudes,&#8217; he says, and goes on to explain that some countries place a high priority on restoring wetlands, while others still deny the issue. McCartney is cautiously optimistic, however, &#8216;Awareness of the importance of wetlands is growing,&#8217; he says. &#8216;It&#8217;s true that wetland degradation still continues at a rapid pace, but my impression is that things are slowly changing.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>** subsidence: the sinking of the Earth&#8217;s surface, most often caused by the removal of resources from the ground</i><br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Is the era of artificial speech translation upon us?</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><i>Once the stuff of science fiction, technology that enables people to talk using different languages is now here. But how effective is it?</i><br></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>Noise, Alex Waibel tells me, is one of the major challenges that artificial speech translation has to meet. A device may be able to recognise speech in a laboratory, or a meeting room, but will struggle to cope with the kind of background noise | can hear in my office surrounding Professor Waibel as he speaks to me from Kyoto station in Japan. I&#8217;m struggling to follow him in English, on a scratchy line that reminds me we are nearly 10,000 kilometres apart &#8212; and that distance is still an obstacle to communication even if you&#8217;re speaking the same language, as we are. We haven&#8217;t reached the future yet. If we had, Waibel would have been able to speak more comfortably in his native German and [ would have been able to hear his words in English.<br></div><div><br></div><div>At Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where he is a professor of computer science, Waibel and his colleagues already give lectures in German that their students can follow in English via an electronic translator. The system generates text that students can read on their laptops or phones, so the process is somewhat similar to subtitling. It helps that lecturers speak clearly, don&#8217;t have to compete with background chatter, and say much the same thing each year.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The idea of artificial speech translation has been around for a long time. Douglas Adams&#8217; science fiction novel, The Hitchhiker s Guide to the Galaxy, published in 1979, featured a life form called the &#8216;Babel fish&#8217; which, when placed in the ear, enabled a listener to understand any language in the universe. It came to represent one of those devices that technology enthusiasts dream of long before they become practically realisable, like TVs flat enough to hang on walls: objects that we once could only dream of having but that are now commonplace. Now devices that look like prototype Babel fish have started to appear, riding a wave of advances in artificial translation and voice recognition.<br></div><div><br></div><div>At this stage, however, they seem to be regarded as eye-catching novelties rather than steps towards what Waibel calls &#8216;making a language-transparent society&#8217;. They tend to be domestic devices or applications suitable for hotel check-ins, for example, providing a practical alternative to speaking traveller&#8217;s English, The efficiency of the translator is less important than the social function. However, &#8216;Professionals are less inclined to be patient in a conversation,&#8217; founder and CEO at Waverly Labs, Andrew Ochoa, observes. To redress this, Waverly is now preparing a new model for professional applications, which entails performance improvements in speech recognition, translation accuracy and the time it takes to deliver the translated speech.<br></div><div><br></div><div>For a conversation, both speakers need to have devices called Pilots (translator earpieces) in their ears. &#8216;We find that there&#8217;s a barrier with sharing one of the earphones with a stranger,&#8217; says Ochoa. That can&#8217;t have been totally unexpected, The problem would be solved if earpiece translators became sufficiently prevalent that strangers would be likely to already have their own in their ears. Whether that happens, and how quickly, will probably depend not so much on the earpieces themselves, but on the prevalence of voice-controlled devices and artificial translation in general.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Waibel highlights the significance of certain Asian nations, noting that voice translation has really taken off in countries such as Japan with a range of systems, There is still a long way to go, though. A translation system needs to be simultancous, like the translator&#8217;s voice speaking over the foreign politician being interviewed on the TY, rather than in sections that oblige speakers to pause after every few remarks and wait for the translation to be delivered. It needs to work offline, for situations where internet access isn&#8217;t possible, and to address apprehensions about the amount of private speech data accumulating in the cloud, having been sent to servers for processing.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Systems not only need to cope with physical challenges such as noise, they will also need to be socially aware by addressing people in the right way. Some cultural traditions demand solemn respect for academic status, for example, and it is only polite to respect this. Etiquette-sensitive artificial translators could relieve people of the need to know these differing cultural norms. At the same time, they might help to preserve local customs, slowing the spread of habits associated with international English, such as its readiness to get on first-name terms.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Professors and other professionals will not outsource language awareness to software, though. If the technology matures into seamless, ubiquitous artificial speech translation, it will actually add value to language skills. Whether it will help people conduct their family lives or relationships is open to question &#8212; though one noteworthy possibility is that it could overcome the language barriers that often arise between generations after migration, leaving children and their grandparents without a shared language.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Whatever uses it is put to, though, it will never be as good as the real thing. Even if voicemorphing technology simulates the speaker&#8217;s voice, their lip movements won&#8217;t match, and they will look like they are in a dubbed movie. The contrast will underline the value of shared languages, and the value of learning them. Sharing a language can promote a sense of belonging and community, as with the international scientists who use English as a lingua franca, where their predecessors used Latin. Though the practical need for a common language will diminish, the social value of sharing one will persist. And software will never be a substitute for the subtle but vital understanding that comes with knowledge of a language.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Modern Irrigation in Farming</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Irrigation has been around for as long as humans have been cultivating plants. Man&#8217;s first invention after he learned how to grow plants from seeds was probably a bucket and ancient people must have been strong from having to haul buckets full of water to pour on their first plants. Pouring water on fields is still a common irrigation method today, but other more efficient and mechanised methods are also used.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The earliest form of irrigation can be described as collecting water in a bucket and pouring it onto the fields and today this is still one of the most popular methods of crop irrigation. This system is called flood irrigation. Water is pumped or brought to the fields and is allowed to flow along the ground among the crops. This method is simple and cheap, and is especially widely used by societies in less developed parts of the world. This method can be quite wasteful. For example, a large part, around 40 per cent, of all the fresh water used in the United States goes to irrigate crops. After use, much of this water cannot be reused, because so much of it evaporates in the fields. If it is considered that the majority of U.S. irrigation occurs in the west, where water is relatively scarce, it can be seen how important it is for farmers to find the most efficient methods of using their irrigation water. In spite of its inherent inefficiency, there are still some things that farmers are doing to improve flood irrigation. Firstly, farmers can level off their fields. Flood irrigation uses gravity to transport water, and, since water flows downhill, it will miss a part of the field that is on a hill, even a small hill. Farmers can use leveling equipment, some of which is guided by a laser beam, to scrape a field flat before planting. That allows water to flow evenly throughout the fields. Secondly, farmers can alter how they do flood irrigation. Traditional flooding involved just releasing water onto a field. In using surge flooding, water is released at prearranged intervals, which reduces unwanted runoff. Finally, a large amount of flood irrigation water is wasted because it runs off the edges and back of the fields. Farmers can capture the runoff in ponds and pump it back up to the front of the field, where it can be reused for the next cycle of irrigation.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A common modern method of irrigation is drip irrigation and this method is much more efficient for irrigating fruits and vegetables than flood irrigation. Water is sent through holed plastic pipes that are either laid along the rows of crops or even buried along their rootlines. Evaporation is cut way down, and up to one-fourth of the water used is saved when compared to flood irrigation. Drip irrigation has gained attention during recent years because of its potential to increase yields and decrease water, fertiliser, and, most importantly, labour requirements if managed properly. Drip irrigation systems can apply water and fertiliser directly to individual plants or trees, reducing the wetted area by wetting only a fraction of the soil surface. Drip irrigation is a challenge for isolated communities or ones with little&#160;access to power sources. A low pressure system has now been developed that allows drip irrigation to take place with the pump being powered by a solar array. The water can therefore be pumped from the water reservoir to the fields and, once there, the root zones can be watered vertically by gravity and laterally by capillary action.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Spray irrigation is a more modern way of irrigating, but it also requires quite expensive machinery. Large-scale spray irrigation systems are in use on large farms today. These systems have a long tube fixed at one end to the water source, such as a well. Water flows through the tube and is shot out by a system of spray guns. A common type of spray-irrigation system is the centre-pivot system. They work in the same way people might water their gardens. If you placed a faucet in the center of your yard, you could take a hose, punch holes all along it, and attach a spray gun at the end. Turn the water on, pull it tight, and start spraying (water is also spraying from the holes in the hose at the same time). While you are spraying, you are also walking around in a circle (with the faucet at the centre of the circle). Using this method, you can get a very large circle of lawn watered with just a short hose. The agricultural centre-pivot systems have a number of metal frames on rolling wheels that hold the water tube and there is a very large water gun at the end of the tube. Electric motors move each frame in a big circle around the field (the tube is fixed at the water source at the centre of the circle), squirting water. However, as spray irrigation basically just shoots water through the air onto fields, in the dry and windy air of the western U.S., a lot of the water sprayed evaporates or blows away before it hits the ground.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Micro-spray is a cross between surface spray irrigation and drip irrigation. It typically creates a larger wetted area than drip irrigation, making it well suited for irrigating ground covers, large flowerbeds and sandy soil. Water is delivered through micro tubing to a series of nozzles attached to risers. These risers may be fixed or designed to pop-up. In either case, it is easy to see that they are functioning, eliminating the most commonly voiced complaint about drip irrigation.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Critical Thinking in the Classroom</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b><br></div><div>The development of critical thinking has been a focus of educators at every level of education for years. There are various definitions of critical thinking, but all of them describe an individual who is actively engaged in the thought process. Not only is this person evaluating, analysing, and interpreting information, he or she is also analysing inferences and assumptions made regarding that information and these processes show involvement in the critical thinking process. These cognitive skills are employed to form a judgment. Unfortunately, not everyone employs critical thinking when solving difficulties. In order to think critically, there must be a certain amount of self-awareness and other characteristics present to enable a person to explain the analysis and interpretation and to evaluate any inferences made.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>Critical thinking can be established in a classroom by the specific and deliberate nurturing of thinking routines. Routines exist in all classrooms; they are the patterns by which teachers operate and go about the job of learning and working together in a classroom environment. A routine can be thought of as any procedure, process, or pattern of action that is used repeatedly to manage and facilitate the accomplishment of specific goals or tasks. Classrooms have routines that serve to manage student behaviour and interactions, to organise the work of learning, and to establish rules for communication and discourse. Classrooms also have routines that structure the way students go about the process of thinking and learning. These learning routines can be simple structures, such as reading from a text and answering the questions at the end of the chapter, or they may be designed to promote students&#8217; critical thinking.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>An assortment of questioning tactics exists to promote critical thinking. Depending on how a question is asked, the student may use various critical thinking skills, such as interpretation, analysis, and recognition of assumptions to form a conclusion. Some educators believe that the thoughtful use of questions may be the quintessential activity of an effective teacher. Questions are only as good as the thought put into them and should go beyond knowledge level recall. Researchers have found that teachers often asked significantly more lower-level cognitive questions than higher-level questions. Questions should be designed to foster evaluation and synthesis of facts and concepts. Higher-level thinking questions should start or end with words or phrases such as, &#8220;explain,&#8221; &#8220;compare,&#8221; &#8220;why&#8221;. Depending on the initial words used in the question, students can be challenged at different levels of cognition.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>In addition to using these questioning techniques, it is equally important to orient the students to this type of classroom interaction and researchers suggest that provocative questions should be brief&#160;and contain only one or two issues at a time for class reflection. It is also important to provide a period of silence for students to think when they are asked these types of questions. These questions help teachers move students from simple responses to engage in more developed complex thinking. This helps the students apply what they understand, to bridge learning from other lessons and different situations, to think more actively in lessons and learn from the answers given by their peers.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>In-class and out-of-class assignments can also serve as powerful vehicles to allow students to expand their thinking processes. Research has shown that involving students in writing serves their learning particularly, because writing, as process and product, possesses a cluster of attributes that correspond uniquely to certain powerful learning strategies. As a general rule, out of class assignments for the purpose of promoting thought should be short and focus on a particular aspect of thinking.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>Developing critical thinking dispositions, whether it is a disposition to strive for understanding, to figure out the complexities of fairness, to seek truth or hunt for creative solutions, occurs within a cultural framework. It is within cultural contexts that we develop our patterns of behaviour and thinking that become our habits. Therefore, teachers should use an enculturative approach to develop students&#8217; thinking, immersing students in a rich culture of thinking in schools and classrooms. Within a culture of critical thinking, students must experience school and college as a place where thinking is valued and given time. Students should be shown that the school environment is full of rich opportunities for thinking in their day-to-day classroom experience and that models of thinking are present when they see teachers and peers as fellow thinkers. Such environments not only provide for the practice of students&#8217; critical thinking skills, but also help them to foster an inclination toward thinking and to develop a greater awareness of thinking occasions.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>Regardless of the methods used to promote critical thinking, care must be taken to consider the many factors that may inhibit a student from thinking critically. The student&#8217;s disposition to think critically is a major factor, and if a deficit in a disposition is noticed, this should be quickly addressed. Students should be encouraged to be inquisitive, ask questions, and not believe and accept everything they are told. Additionally, faculty should be aware of their course goals and learning objectives. If these goals and objectives are stated as higher-order thought outcomes, then activities that promote critical thinking should be included in classroom activities and assignments. Finally, it is important that critical thinking skills be encouraged and reinforced in all classes by teaching faculty at every level of education. Quick results should not be anticipated, as critical thought develops with practice and evaluation over time using multiple strategies. Although huge gains in critical thinking may not be reflected in all students straight away, teachers can still plant the seed and encourage students to use their thinking abilities in the hope these will grow over time.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u><br></div><div><u><br></u></div><div>Enculturative Taking into account culture.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Electronic Monitoring of Criminals</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Electronic monitoring is used to monitor curfews and conditions of a court or prison order. It provides an alternative to incarceration and gives structure, control, and accountability to probationers who have been sentenced to house arrest by a judge. The program also provides an extra layer of supervision.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Currently, there are two types of tag monitors, both usually fitted to an individual&#8217;s ankle: tags for curfew supervision using only radio frequency (RFT) transmission, and tags for monitoring location and movement, which combine RF with global positioning system (GPS) technology. The vast majority of cases, around 12,300 to 14,000 offenders at any one time last year, are under curfew tagging orders. Curfew tags transmit information on an individual&#8217;s location only in relation to their home. The information is reviewed by staff at a monitoring centre to check that the individual is complying with their home curfew order. So far, location monitoring tags have been used on very few cases, usually fewer than 20 at any time. These allow an individual&#8217;s location and movements to be monitored wherever they go.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There is a range of potential advantages associated with the use of electronic monitoring. One of the major advantages is the possibility of reduced prison populations. This is most likely where monitoring is used as an alternative to prison, rather than to enhance existing non-custodial orders. Major cost savings may be achieved through building fewer prisons, as well as reducing the cost of administering custodial sentences. A second advantage is that research has shown that electronic monitoring creates significant decreases in the recidivism rate for all groups of offenders, and that the decreases were similar for all age groups. Electronic monitoring based on GPS typically has even more of an effect on reducing recidivism than RFT systems. Another advantage is the improvement of rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders. Electronic monitoring allows more offenders to maintain employment and contact with their families, as they&#8217;re not in prison. It also avoids the negative psychological effects of incarceration, although of course the wearing of a device itself can impose anxiety.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A disadvantage of electronic monitoring is the lack of incapacitation. Electronic monitoring does not physically restrain a person and dangerous offenders are still able to offend before authorities can intervene. Also, the less onerous conditions of home detention with electronic monitoring may result in victims perceiving some offenders as being dealt with too leniently. In addition, although offenders have more contact with their families with the electronic monitoring system, many probation officers and offenders believe that monitoring has a negative impact on offenders&#8217; relationships with their spouses, children and friends.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another important issue to take account of is that use of electronic monitoring, particularly through the use of devices fixed to their body, or even implanted beneath the skin, raises serious civil liberty and ethical concerns. As monitoring is predominantly applicable in correctional contexts, the question of punishment arises because of the power of modern monitoring technologies to facilitate restriction&#160;and surveillance. Although not a punishment in itself, electronic monitoring has the potential to enforce restrictions upon a person&#8217;s liberty in connection with a judicially imposed punishment, such as home detention. It is also psychologically invasive in the sense that the person&#8217;s every move can be tracked, other than when the device is programmed to be off. A view expressed by some is that home detention is simply an alternative to experiencing incarceration, albeit in a less restrictive environment.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Industry has played a pivotal role in the growth of electronic monitoring. In some jurisdictions, private sector firms operate systems and even attach the device to the offender, which raises many contentious issues surrounding the role of the private sector in prison management, including accountability, training and service quality. Financial considerations can also arise. Especially when electronic monitoring is enforced through the private sector, some offenders involved in the programs are required to pay a fee towards the cost of the equipment and the monitoring. This is partially justified by the argument that offenders who remain in the community can continue in employment (if they are able to find suitable work). The logical extension is, however, that all offenders on communitybased programs should be required to contribute to correctional costs. This could place hardship on those with low incomes and high family maintenance costs.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Electronic monitoring also raises the important legal question of whether specific legislative provisions should be enacted to authorise such an invasive program. In other words, should the general legal power to impose conditions be interpreted as authority to order electronic monitoring? This is currently the position in some jurisdictions where electronic monitoring is used under the court&#8217;s general power to impose conditions on an individual. If that power is sufficient to require a person to wear a monitoring device, does it also authorise a court to compel an individual to submit to a surgically implanted device, something not yet currently legal?<br></div><div><br></div><div>The use of electronic monitoring has the potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of correctional programs, provide enhanced opportunities for offender rehabilitation and extend the range of sentences available to the courts. Despite the fact that electronic monitoring has been in use for two decades, there are still many legal, ethical and practical issues to resolve. Although the latest technologies are more efficient than in the past, their surveillance potential creates concerns of overregulation and infringement of human rights. An awareness of these developments is important, as is the creation of policies to ensure that if such technologies are adopted, they are used in the most productive and ethical ways. In particular, the necessity for ensuring informed consent of those chosen to be subject to monitoring has to be guaranteed and effective procedures established to deal with unethical or illegal practices.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossar</u><br></div><div><u><br></u></div><div>Curfew&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The requirement for people to remain at home at certain hours, usually at night.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Recidivism&#160; &#160; &#160;The reoffending after release of a convicted prisoner.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Story of Cashmere</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>Cashmere is made from processing the hair of the goat Capra hircus that lives on the Tibetan highlands in the Himalayas and Mongolia. This animal produces particularly fine wool that is soft and warm, which protects it from the harshness of winters, when temperatures can go down to minus 40 degrees Celsius. Depending on the thread selection, a higher or lower quality cashmere is created. This usually ranges from thin (2-ply) to very thick (10 to 12-ply). Cashmere is much softer, warmer and more isothermal than sheep&#8217;s wool. People can also wear it directly against the skin, as it does not produce itching or rash, unlike wool.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>It is said that, in the thirteenth century in Mongolian grottoes, Marco Polo discovered representations of wild goats, domesticated by man. It is therefore likely that some shepherds raised these goats, capable of providing particularly warm wool, a long time ago. Only in the nineteenth century did Europeans discover the precious wool that would later be known as cashmere.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>The name cashmere came about because the processing of the precious wool first developed in the Kashmir region of India and the name of this region thus became the generic name of the fabric. Since then things have changed, as Indian production, having failed to evolve, has been considerably marginalised. Despite this, the majority of travellers who go to India continue to buy very cheap &#8216;Pashmina&#8217; as souvenirs. Most of these, however, are actually made of 100 per cent viscose and are cheaply produced for unwary tourists.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>Cashmere growth on the goat is generally regarded as being triggered by the shortening daylight hours of late summer and autumn, although many people believe that other factors, such as temperature and even diet, have an influence on the production of the cashmere. The coat continues to grow until the end of the year just before the coldest weather and is removed in the early to late spring. Cashmere can be harvested in two ways, depending on whether the goats are still wild or domesticated. In the Himalayas, a completely artisanal and eco-friendly method is used: when the goat is hot, it rubs against rocks and shrubs to speed up the moulting, leaving behind many clumps of hair. The local mountain people then walk throughout the mountains to collect the fluff. The other way of gathering cashmere is for the domesticated goats and the wool is obtained by shearing. A goat produces only 100 grams of usable cashmere, so in order to make a pullover, the wool from at least 2 goats is needed, but can range up to 6 goats. Once the wool has been gathered, it is scoured or washed to remove any dirt, dried and then de-haired, which separates the main coat from the cashmere hair. Usually, only about&#160;20 per cent of what is gathered can be classed as true cashmere. This is then dyed, spun, knitted or woven. The breeding of the goats remains very traditional and makes a significant contribution to the sustenance of a traditional rural population.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>In traditional areas where people farm specifically for cashmere wool, some issues have arisen. As drivers of terrestrial ecosystems, humans have replaced large animals in most areas, and human influence not only exerts striking ecological pressures on biodiversity at local scales, but also has indirect effects in distant corners of the world. The multibillion-dollar cashmere industry creates economic motivations that link western fashion preferences for cashmere to land use in Central Asia. The penchant for stylish and comfortable clothing encourages herders to increase livestock production, which affects the environment of over 6 endangered large mammals in the remote, arid ecosystems, where cashmere goats are farmed. The attraction of farming cashmere goats is the price of the end fabric. Part of the reason for the price is a simple matter of supply and demand: it can take up to four years for a goat to produce enough cashmere wool to make one sweater. The fact that it is so time-consuming to produce means its value is increased. But it&#8217;s not just this that makes cashmere such a pricey fabric. The fibres are longer, finer, sturdier and more isothermal than sheep wool, making it an ideal choice for clothes and blankets. Its melting softness adds to its appeal, with people willing to pay more for a garment that will offer them greater comfort.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>In response to demand from the UK textile industry, a cashmere fibre producing industry is being established in Scotland by a small group of farmers. Scottish reared goats are producing Scottish cashmere to enhance the quality of the finest of Scottish knitwear and accessories. It all began in 1985 when, as a result of initial research in Scotland, several farmers recognised the benefits of integrating cashmere-producing goats into their existing farm management systems. Compared to world production, Scottish cashmere farmers are producing tiny amounts of fibre, but the next challenge is to build up the national herd to at least 10,000 goats, and to develop a sustainable industry in control of its own future.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>Goats are no strangers to the hill and upland farms of Scotland. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, farmed herds were common all over the country. Major changes in social structure and agriculture led to their decline and their potential remained forgotten until recently. The Scottish cashmere industry is now re-emerging and, improved by crossing the cashmere goat with the hardy Scottish feral to create a hardy and adaptable hybrid, it is going from strength to strength.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u><br></div><div><u><br></u></div><blockquote><div>Isothermal&#160; &#160;Isothermal clothing allows the wearer&#8217;s temperature to remain approximately constant whether the wearer is moving or at rest.</div></blockquote>",

          "content": "<b>Music and Health</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Music is a fundamental attribute of the human species. Virtually all cultures, from the most primitive to the most advanced, make music. It&#8217;s been true through history, and it&#8217;s true throughout an individual&#8217;s lifespan. In tune or not, we humans sing and hum; in time or not, we clap and sway; in step or not, we dance and bounce. The neurobiology of music is a highly specialised field and music has major effects on many aspects of health, ranging from memory and mood to cardiovascular function and athletic performance.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The human brain and nervous system are hard-wired to distinguish music from noise and to respond to rhythm and repetition, tones and tunes. Like any sound, music arrives at the ear in the form of sound waves. The external ear collects sound waves, and a canal funnels them to the eardrum. As the waves strike the eardrum, they cause it to vibrate. The vibrations are relayed along a chain of tiny bones in the middle ear until they reach the third bone, the stapes, which connects to the cochlea. The cochlea is a busy little world of its own. It is filled with fluid that surrounds some 10,000 to 15,000 tiny hair cells, or cilia. Vibrations of the stapes send fluid waves through the spiral-shaped cochlea. The fluid waves produce swaying movements of the hair cells. In turn, these cells release neurotransmitters that activate the auditory nerve, sending miniature electric currents to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe of the brain. From there, things get even more complicated. Studies using magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography scans suggest that nerve networks in different parts of the brain bear primary responsibility for decoding and interpreting various properties of sound, including music. For example, a small area in the right temporal lobe is essential to perceive pitch, which forms the basis of melody, chords and harmony. Another nearby centre is responsible for decoding timbre, the quality that allows the brain to distinguish between different instruments that are playing the same note. A different part of the brain, the cerebellum, processes rhythm, and the frontal lobes interpret the emotional content of music. And music that&#8217;s powerful enough to be &#8216;spinetingling&#8217; can light up the brain&#8217;s reward centre, much like pleasurable stimuli, such as chocolate.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Although every healthy human brain can perform all the complex tasks needed to perceive music, musicians&#8217; brains are, so to speak, more finely attuned to these tasks. At the other end of the spectrum, patients with brain damage may display remarkable defects in musicality. As playing a musical instrument engages many parts of the brain at once, it can especially benefit children and teens, whose brains are still developing. Introducing music to young kids can positively influence their ability to focus, how they act, and language development, even when the training starts as late as high school. Being musical can also protect people from hearing loss as they advance in years. People naturally lose their hearing ability over time. In particular, it becomes harder to hear multi-person conversations. Researchers have found that musicians are better at picking out people&#8217;s voices from noisy backgrounds, which is often an early symptom of a person&#8217;s hearing worsening.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Listening to and making music on your own can bring health benefits, but some people may also benefit from the help of a board-certified music therapist. Music therapists are trained in how to use music to meet the mental, social, and physical needs of people with different health conditions. Music therapists can use certain parts of music, like the rhythm or melody, to help people regain abilities they&#8217;ve lost from a brain injury or developmental disability. For example, an experimental technique called music intonation therapy is now used for people who can&#8217;t talk following a stroke. If patients can learn to sing and mimic the rhythms of simple songs, different regions of the brain may gradually take over some speaking functions.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Music therapists also rely on the social qualities of music. For example, shared musical experiences can help a family member connect with old relatives and even a loved one who has dementia. Music can also be used to help young people with behaviour disorders learn ways to manage their emotions. On the other hand, it&#8217;s important to recognise that while music can offer many health benefits, it may not be helpful for everyone. Brain injuries and brain conditions can change the way a person perceives and responds to music and so some people may find some types of music too stimulating and others may find that certain music brings up emotional or traumatic memories. If used correctly, music-based activities can represent a valid and without side effects intervention for reducing psychological and behavioural disturbances related to neurological disorders, and for promoting the functional recovery. Specifically, the most significant results of the music interventions on the psychological side can be identified in the aspects more closely related to mood, especially in the reduction of depression, anxiety and in dealing with the pressures of everyday life. This can in turn lead to an improvement in people&#8217;s emotional expression, communication and interpersonal skills, self esteem and quality of life.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Music is a reflection of culture. In today&#8217;s world, people are experiencing an unprecedented fusion of ideas through the Internet and technology. People are re-mixing historical themes, embellishing forgotten ideas and combining belief systems across time and societies. Music is one way to help process and deal with this overload of information.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Crosswords &#8211; Exercise for the Brain</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Crossword puzzles are said to be the most popular and widespread word game in the world, yet they have a short history. The first crosswords appeared in England during the nineteenth century. They were of an elementary kind, apparently derived from the word square, a group of words arranged so the letters read alike vertically and horizontally, and printed in children&#8217;s puzzle books. In the United States, however, the puzzle developed into a serious adult pastime.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The first known published crossword puzzle was created on December 21, 1913 by a journalist named Arthur Wynne from Liverpool, and he is usually credited as being the inventor of the popular word game. Wynne&#8217;s puzzle differed from today&#8217;s crosswords in that it was diamond shaped and contained no internal black squares. During the early 1920&#8217;s, other newspapers picked up the newly discovered pastime and within a decade, crossword puzzles were featured in almost all American newspapers. It was in this period that crosswords began to assume their familiar form. Ten years after their rebirth in the States, they crossed the Atlantic and re-conquered Europe.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The first appearance of a crossword in a British publication was in Pearson&#8217;s Magazine in February 1922, and the first Times newspaper crossword appeared on February 1st 1930. British puzzles quickly developed their own style, being considerably more difficult than the American variety. In particular the cryptic crossword became established and rapidly gained popularity.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Crossword makers, gifted with the ability to see words puzzled together in given geometrical patterns and capable of twisting and turning words into word plays dancing on the wit of human minds, have since constructed millions of puzzles by hand and each of these puzzlers has developed personal styles known and loved by his fans. These people have set the standard of what to expect from a quality crossword puzzle.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There are various benefits people can get from crossword puzzles. Firstly, they improve people&#8217;s moods. There&#8217;s something very satisfying about completing a crossword puzzle and that sense of satisfaction is more beneficial than it might first appear. It causes people&#8217;s brain to produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter that makes people feel pleasure. Dopamine is often released as people work towards a goal, with a final burst when they achieve the goal. It&#8217;s one of nature&#8217;s ways of keeping people happy and motivated as they go through life. On the other hand, dopamine will naturally drop if no stimulation or excitement is felt over time and low levels of dopamine can result in feelings of apathy, depression and low energy. Through gaining small achievements throughout the week by doing crosswords, people&#8217;s dopamine levels can naturally stay high.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Secondly, the cerebral challenges from crosswords have been proven to help prevent age-related neurological disorders like dementia and Alzheimer&#8217;s disease. Recent studies found that the more often someone engages in mentally demanding activities, such as reading or doing crosswords, the less build up they have in their brains of certain toxic proteins that can lead to diseases related to age&#160;deterioration. Including cognitively challenging hobbies and tasks in people&#8217;s early and middle years seems to be especially helpful in preventing the accumulation of these toxic proteins.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Thirdly, crosswords are a fun and engaging way to distract people for a while. They provide excellent &#8216;alone time&#8217;, when people can safely decompress and unwind. In fact, research has shown that intellectually demanding activities like crossword puzzles or chess may be more effective for reducing anxieties than supposedly relaxing activities like watching TV or shopping.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Fourthly, the mental task of putting words together in a crossword puzzle can also help people&#8217;s language skills. Puzzlers have often claimed that there is a noticeable improvement in their verbal communication skills after a period of completing at least one crossword puzzle a day.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Fifthly, in spite of crossword puzzles being generally considered a solitary pursuit, doing one with a family member or a group of friends can have various benefits. Research has shown that working in a team can improve people&#8217;s speed of thinking and talking and strengthen their collaboration and dispute resolution skills. Doing crosswords with others can also be a great way to bond and share experiences. As an added bonus, everyone will get the same health benefits while creating happy memories together.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Finally, teachers use crosswords as an informal assessment and reinforcement tool. Crosswords including important vocabulary can easily be created using free crossword generators and given to students as a fun way to produce cognitive activity. Students can complete the puzzles on their own or they can be encouraged to interact with each other to promote cohesive learning. In general, teachers and students like this way of informally testing and revising important material, as they feel that crossword puzzles enhance their learning and provide informal formative feedback on those areas on which students need to spend more time.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The belief that crosswords are good for the brain is not shared by everyone. Skeptics point out that crossword puzzles flex one very specific piece of cognition, which is the ability to find words. This is also known as fluency. Fluency is a type of process based in the language centre of the brain, so the skeptics claim that doing crosswords might help people get better at word finding, but that&#8217;s the sum total of the positive benefits to the brain. Even the skeptics have some advice, though. They claim that by adding a time limit or by seeing how fast a crossword can be done, people can push their brains to the next level. They also suggest that doing a daily crossword is a good way to see if a person&#8217;s memory is as good as it was.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Social Intelligence</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Social intelligence is the ability to get along well with others, and to get them to cooperate with you. Sometimes referred to simplistically as &#8216;people skills,&#8217; social intelligence includes people&#8217;s awareness of themselves and the social dynamics around them, and knowledge of the interaction styles and strategies that can help a person achieve his or her objectives in dealing with others. It also involves a certain amount of self-insight and a consciousness of one&#8217;s own perceptions and reaction patterns. The socially intelligent person knows how to play different roles, allowing him or her to feel comfortable with whoever is being interacted with. As a result, the socially intelligent individual feels self-confident and effective, what psychologists call &#8216;social self-efficacy.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div>From the standpoint of interpersonal skills, psychologists have classified behaviour towards others as falling somewhere on a spectrum between a &#8216;toxic&#8217; effect and a &#8216;nourishing&#8217; effect. Toxic behaviour makes people feel devalued, angry, frustrated, guilty or otherwise inadequate. Nourishing behaviour makes people feel valued, respected, affirmed, encouraged or competent. Continued patterns of toxic behaviour indicates a low level of social intelligence, which is the inability to connect with people and influence them effectively. Nourishing behaviour, on the other hand, tends to make a person much more effective in dealing with others.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The old idea that a person&#8217;s potential in life can be measured and predicted by a single number - his or her &#8216;IQ&#8217; score - has lost a great deal of credibility during the last decade or so. Many researchers now accept Professor Howard Gardner&#8217;s proposition that intelligence is multidimensional, and many believe that each of the key dimensions of intelligence can continue to increase throughout one&#8217;s life, given suitable opportunities. Social intelligence is one of these intelligences.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Social intelligence is often mixed up with emotional intelligence and some psychologists have included social intelligence as part of Gardner&#8217;s emotional intelligence. In practical terms, however, it makes more sense to think of emotional intelligence and social intelligence as two discrete competences. Social intelligence is separate from, but complimentary to emotional intelligence, and Gardner himself differentiates them by referring to them as interpersonal intelligence (social) and intrapersonal intelligence (emotional). People need both models in order to understand themselves and the way they interact with others. This is not to say that these two intelligences are mutually exclusive. Some deficits in social intelligence arise from inadequate development of emotional intelligence; conversely, some deficits in social intelligence may lead to unsuccessful social experiences. These shortcomings may undermine a person&#8217;s self-worth, which is part of emotional intelligence.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In the simplest terms, social intelligence is to have effective relationships with people, which most people generally learn as they grow up, mature, and gain experience in dealing with others. Unfortunately, many people do not continue to learn and develop these skills as they age, and many people never acquire the awareness and skills they need to succeed in social, business or professional situations. As social intelligence is highly valued in business environments, there have therefore been many efforts to teach it. By first understanding social intelligence as a combination of skills expressed through learned behavior, and then assessing the impact of one&#8217;s behaviour on others &#8211; i.e. the degree to which one is successful in dealing with others &#8211; people can learn to experiment with new behaviours and new interaction strategies. It is quite clear that adults who are deficient in insight and competence in dealing with others can make significant improvements in their social intelligence status as a result of understanding the basic concepts, but they need to be able to assess themselves continually against a comprehensive model of interpersonal effectiveness.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Measuring social intelligence was once thought to be impossible, but psychologists have developed a number of ways of doing so. The social intelligence quotient is a statistical abstraction, similar to the standard score approach used in IQ tests, with a mean of 100. Scores of 140 or above are considered to be very high. Unlike the standard IQ test, it is not a fixed model. It leans more to the point of view that intelligence is not a fixed attribute, but a complex hierarchy of information-processing skills underlying an adaptive equilibrium between the individual and the environment. Therefore, an individual can change their social intelligence quotient by altering their attitudes and behaviour in response to their complex social environment. People with a low social intelligence quotient are more suited to work with low customer contact, as well as in smaller groups or teams, or independently, because they may not have the required interpersonal communication and social skills for success with customers and other co-workers. People with a social intelligence quotient over 120 are considered socially skilled, and may work exceptionally well with jobs that involve direct contact and communication with other people.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Today&#8217;s society, especially in a school context, has always put much more significant emphasis on traditional proofs of intelligence, such as IQ and doing well at school and college, than social intelligence, and this does not look set to change. However, most people&#8217;s lives are much more affected by their social interactions. People&#8217;s relationships partners, friends, colleagues and children all significantly enhance people&#8217;s well-being and everyday happiness. If people invested more in their social intelligence skills then they could find themselves in a life with which they were much more satisfied.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>U.S. Coastal Change</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>U.S. coastal lands and sediments are constantly in motion. Breaking waves move sand along the coast, eroding sand in one area and depositing it on an adjacent beach. Tidal cycles bring sand onto the beach and carry it back into the surf. Rivers carry sediment to the coast and build deltas in the open water. Storms cause deep erosion in rock cliffs and leave thick overwash deposits in other coastal areas. Plants retain sediment in wetlands and impede movement of coastal dunes. Taken individually, each natural process of coastal transport is complex; taken collectively, they create an extraordinarily intricate system that attempts to achieve a natural balance.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>While the same dynamic processes cause continuous change on every coast, coasts do not all respond in the same way. Interactions among the different processes and the degree to which a particular process controls change depend upon localised factors. They include the coast&#8217;s proximity to sediment-laden rivers and tectonic activity, the topography and composition of the land, the prevailing wind and weather patterns, and the configuration of the coastline and nearshore geometry. Earthscience research is showing that these surroundings determine not only the changes to the coast, but also the type of coast produced.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>People&#8217;s activities add another layer of complexity to the natural processes of coastal lands and materials, and these activities may have direct or indirect effects on our changing coasts. They may affect sources of new sediment taken to the coast and the movement of sediment within the coastal environment, and they may promote changes in sea level, both local and global. People&#8217;s activities are often conducted without an adequate understanding of coastal geology and processes, and, as a result, they can lead to unforeseen degradation of coasts. Even people&#8217;s actions intended to save or improve the coast may inadvertently increase erosion. Cooperative investigations are starting to provide the crucial information needed to minimise the unintended effects of people&#8217;s disturbances along coasts.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>As the number of active landfills dwindles and coastal populations grow, offshore waste dumping and coastal contamination increase. This additional dumping also increases the amount of improper waste disposal affecting the coastal environment and water quality. Living coral reefs are particularly vulnerable, but other coastal environments suffer as well. Medical waste, including used hypodermic needles, was washed onto the New Jersey and New York beaches during the summer of 1988, resulting in an economic disaster for the recreation industries in the region. Fishing industries have also been severely damaged by this and more than one-third of U.S. shellfish beds are closed or restricted as a result of contamination.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>The southeastern coast, rimmed by a series of shorelines on obstructive islands and spits, separates the mainland coastal plain from a wide, gently sloping offshore continental shelf. This generally tectonically stable region has a hurricane season during the late summer to winter months. Most rivers cutting through the low-lying coastal plain flow slowly to the sea and deposit their sand-sized sediment in bays and estuaries before reaching the coast. The river&#8217;s suspended load of finer particles settles out in the sounds and bays that are protected by the obstructive islands and spits. The major source of new sediment to these beaches of the southeastern United States is from the erosion of adjacent headlands and beaches, whose sand generally migrates south as a result of longshore transport. Sand transported landward from the continental shelf may also contribute to the coast and nearshore sand budget.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>Dune erosion occurs when storm surge elevates waves higher on the beach, allowing them to attack and erode coastal dunes. As sand is removed from a dune, the front face becomes very steep, or scarped. The overall volume and elevation of the dune is reduced due to the erosion process. Dune erosion threatens houses behind the dunes as the area becomes significantly more vulnerable to future storms and the potential for overwash, which is when storm-induced waves exceed the height of the dune and transport sand over the top of the dune and deposit it inland. Depending on the severity of the storm, the overwash can extend several hundred metres. The eroded sediment from the dune is carried offshore and stored in large sandbars. The sand dune can recover over a period of years, gaining in elevation and volume through deposits of wind-blown sand. However, because dunes rebuild over a long period, many coastal counties choose to build temporary dunes following a large storm.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>One specific way that coasts are altered is through longshore drifting, which is mainly seen with sand beaches, although clay, silt and shingle beaches are also affected. The sand on beaches is largely supplied over time by rivers flowing into the sea. Longshore drifting is then responsible for moving this sand along the coast line. It is caused when waves approach a beach at a slight angle. After the wave has broken on the beach, the swash runs back downslope perpendicular to the shoreline. This results in sand removal downdrift from the beach. Sand is therefore transported predominantly in one direction and the beach eventually ceases to exist.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Science of Online Dating</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>As the saying goes, &#8220;love defies all calculation&#8221;. Yet, this apparently obvious assertion is challenged by the intrusion of science into matters of love, including the application of scientific analysis to modern forms of courtship. An increasing number of dating services boast about their use of biological research and genetic testing to better match prospective partners. Yet, while research continues to disentangle the complex factors that make humans fall in love, the application of this research remains dubious.<br></div><div><br></div><div>With the rise of the Internet and profound changes in contemporary lifestyles, online dating has gained enormous popularity among people of all ages. Dating website owner Don Walker explains. &#8220;Increased working hours, increasing mobility and the dissolution of traditional modes of socialisation mean that more and more people are using chat rooms and professional dating services to find partners.&#8221; Notwithstanding the current downturn in the economy, the online dating industry continues to prosper. With subscription prices between 20 and 30 dollars per month, romance-seekers are turning away from the traditional and often expensive strategies of meeting people, and are instead opting for less spontaneous, but practical, cheap online services that allow them to find a soul mate from the comfort of a desk.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Most dating services match subscribers based on metrics that include education and professional background, personal interests, hobbies, values, relationship skills and life goals. These websites use a range of personality tests to collate the traits that individuals seek in an ideal partner. Yet, in this modern era of personalised genomes and DNA-based crime fighting, the new generation of online dating services has added one more parameter: biology. Indeed, biological anthropologists and neuroscientists have already dissected some of the chemical ingredients of love, including the security that we experience when we are attached to a specific partner for the long term. Such studies aim to unravel both the genetic factors and the neural circuits that underlie love. Researcher Amanda Torres gives the progress. &#8220;We have found that the relevant regions of the brain are mainly those involved in motivational and reward systems and are orchestrated by hormones and neurotransmitters. Love can accordingly be described as a chemical phenomenon and we can compare it with a state of physical dependence.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Helen Mills, professor of anthropology at a respected Australian University, has created a test for a popular online dating website in which questions are designed to establish a range of basic information about brain and body chemistry associated with specific aspects of temperament and personality. For instance, measuring the ratio between the length of the index finger and the ring finger of the right hand is a possible marker for testosterone, and eye measurements can provide information about assertive, verbal, musical or analytical capabilities. Other questions, supposedly based on dopamine levels in the brain, can determine a propensity to be curious or a tendency to seek novel experiences. Mills justifies her rationale. &#8220;We fall in love with someone who has a chemical profile that complements our own. Therefore a good knowledge of an individual&#8217;s chemistry can be a significant factor in finding the right person for them.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>The customers of online dating services seem to buy the &#8216;hard science&#8217; sell. &#8220;We are receiving requests from a lot of customers who wish to know whether they can test their genetic compatibility with other subscribers in the same area where they live,&#8221; commented Linda Brown, chief scientific officer at another popular dating website. &#8220;Right now, the number of established couples willing to know whether their compatibility is confirmed genetically equals the number of singles who ask us to match them with other subscribers in our database.&#8221; Brown emphasised that the company uses biological compatibility to complement social, psychological and intellectual information, which, she said, &#8220;will continue to play an important role in the formation of lasting relationships.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>The use of genetic information seems to give customers reassurance that they will find a better match. Nevertheless, the real question remains as to whether the use of genetics is proving more effective than traditional matching methods. Indeed, there is a good deal of skepticism concerning the reliability of DNA-based dating services. Courtship and romantic love are complex phenomena that involve many genes and a multitude of social and cultural factors. Deciphering the genetics and neurochemistry of love might, therefore, cast a disenchanting shadow over some cultural practices. Jim Young, a U.S.-based psychologist gives his opinion. &#8220;I think that matching people by personality types or interests may be very useful. However, any service that claims to use genetic information, or any estimation of neurochemistry based on personality or genotype does not have any basis in reality.&#8221; Young, who investigates the genetics and molecular mechanisms behind social attachment, also points out that &#8220;although we might be beginning to understand how some genes contribute to social relationships, the situation is far too complex to begin to think we can pick &#8216;the perfect match&#8217; based on this information. Internet dating websites that claim they can do this exploit a gullible public who have been educated by the media.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>In addition to the potentially disenchanting effect of using science to prescribe romance, emotional compatibility and loving relationships, the increasing tendency to apply genetics to multiple areas of social interaction and behaviour raises more general issues about the growing encroachment of genetics and neuroscience into personal lives. Haunted by the uncertainties of life, humans are drawn to any service or person that promises to foretell the future. Perhaps it was therefore only a matter of time before biology became entangled in attempting to predict the creation of love and the outcome of relationships.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The impact of climate change on butterflies in Britain</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>According to conservationists, populations of around two thirds of butterfly species have declined in Britain over the past 40 years. If this trend continues, it might have unpredictable knock-on effects for other species in the ecosystem. Butterfly eggs develop into caterpillars and these insects, which are the second stage in a new butterfly&#8217;s lifecycle, consume vast quantities of plant material, and in turn act as prey for birds as well as bats and other small mammals. Only by arming themselves with an understanding of why butterfly numbers are down can conservationists hope to halt or reverse the decline.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Butterflies prefer outdoor conditions to be &#8216;just right&#8217;, which means neither too hot nor too cold. Under the conditions of climate change, the temperature at any given time in summer is generally getting warmer, leaving butterflies with the challenge of how to deal with this. One of the main ways in which species are ensuring conditions suit them is by changing the time of year at which they are active and reproduce. Scientists refer to the timing of such lifecycle events as &#8216;phenology&#8217;, so when an animal or plant starts to do something earlier in the year than it usually does, it is said to be &#8216;advancing its phenology&#8217;.<br></div><div><br></div><div>These advances have been observed already in a wide range of butterflies &#8212; indeed, most species are advancing their phenology to some extent. In Britain, as the average spring temperature has increased by roughly 0.5 &#176;C over the past 20 years, species have advanced by between three days and a week on average, to keep in line with cooler temperatures. Is this a sign that butterflies are well equipped to cope with climate change, and readily adjust to new temperatures? Or are these populations under stress, being dragged along unwillingly by unnaturally fast changes? The answer is still unknown, but a new study is seeking to answer these questions.<br></div><div><br></div><div>First, the researchers pulled together data from millions of records that had been submitted by butterfly enthusiasts &#8212; people who spend their free time observing the activities of different species. This provided information on 130 species of butterflies in Great Britain every year for a 20-year period. They then estimated the abundance and distribution of each species across this time, along with how far north in the country they had moved. The data also, crucially, allowed researchers to estimate subtle changes in what time of the year each species was changing into an adult butterfly.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Analysing the trends in each variable, the researchers discovered that species with more flexible lifecycles were more likely to be able to benefit from an earlier emergence driven by climate change. Some species are able to go from caterpillar to butterfly twice or more per year, so that the individual butterflies you see flying in the spring are the grandchildren or great-grandchildren of the individuals seen a year previously.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Among these species, researchers observed that those which have been advancing their phenology the most over the 20-year study period also had the most positive trends in abundance, distribution and northwards extent. For these species, such as Britain&#8217;s tiniest butterfly, the dainty Small Blue, whose colonies are up to a hundred strong, some develop into butterflies early in spring, allowing their summer generations to complete another reproductive cycle by autumn so that more population growth occurs.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Other species, however, are less flexible and restricted to a single reproductive cycle per year. For these species, there was no evidence of any benefit to emerging earlier. Indeed, worryingly, it was found that the species in this group that specialise in very specific habitat types, often related to the caterpillar&#8217;s preferred diet, actually tended to be most at harm from advancing phenology. The beautiful High Brown Fritillary, often described as Britain&#8217;s most endangered butterfly, is in this group. It is found only in coppiced woodland and limestone pavement habitats. It is also a single-generation butterfly that has advanced its phenology. This suggests that climate change, while undoubtedly not the sole cause, might have played a part in the downfall of this species.<br></div><div><br></div><div>All is not lost, however. Many of Britain&#8217;s single-generation species show the capacity, in continental Europe, to add a second generation in years that are sufficiently warm. Therefore, as the climate continues to warm, species like the Silver-studded Blue might be able to switch to multiple generations in the UK as well, and so begin to extract benefits from the additional warmth, potentially leading to population increases.<br></div><div><br></div><div>More immediately, conservationists can arm themselves with all this knowledge to spot the warning signs of species that may be at risk. The White Admiral of southern England, a much sought-after butterfly, experienced a significant increase in numbers from the 1920s but has shown a considerable decline in the past 20 years. This may be because the caterpillar exists solely on a diet of a plant called honeysuckle. But it is also likely to be due to climate change.<br></div>",

But habitats are at risk A 88 from the hunger for marine minerals</i><br></div><div><i><br></i></div><div><b>A</b></div><div>When Professor Mat Upton found that a microbe from a deep-sea sponge was killing pathogenic bugs in his laboratory, he realised it could be a breakthrough in the fight against antibiotic-resistant superbugs, which are responsible for thousands of deaths a year in the UK alone. Further tests confirmed that an antibiotic from the sponge bacteria, found living more than 700 metres under the sea at the Rockall trough in the north-east Atlantic, was previously unknown to science, boosting its potential as a life-saving medicine. But Upton, and other scientists who view the deep ocean and its wealth of unique and undocumented species as a prospecting ground for new medicines, fear such potential will be lost in the rush to exploit the deep sea&#8217;s equally rich metal and mineral resources.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>&#8216;We're looking at the bioactive potential of marine resources, to see if there are any more medicines or drugs down there before we destroy it for ever,&#8217; says Upton, a medical microbiologist at the University of Plymouth. He is among many scientists urging a halt to deep-sea mining, asking for time to weigh up the pros and cons, &#8216;In sustainability terms, this could be a better way of exploiting the economic potential of the deep sea,&#8217; he argues. Oceanographers using remotely operated vehicles have spotted many new species. Among them have been sea cucumbers with tails allowing them to sail along the ocean floor, and a rare &#8216;Dumbo&#8217; octopus, found 3,000 metres under the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of California. Any one of these could offer lifesaving potential. Upton estimates it could take up to a decade for a newly discovered antibiotic to become a medicine &#8212; but the race towards commercial mining in the ocean abyss has already begun.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>The deep sea contains more nickel, cobalt and rare earth metals than all land reserves combined, according to the US Geological Survey. Mining corporations argue that deepsea exploration could help diversify the supply of metals and point to the fact that demand for resources such as copper, aluminium, cobalt for electric car batteries and other metals to power technology and smartphones, is soaring. They say that deep-sea mining could yield far superior ore to land mining with little, ifany, waste. Different methods of extraction exist, but most involve employing some form of converted machinery previously used in terrestrial mining to excavate materials from the sea floor, at depths of up to 6,000 metres, then drawing a seawater slurry, containing rock and other solid particles, from the sea floor to ships on the surface. The slurry is then &#8216;de-watered&#8217; and transferred to another vessel for shipping. Extracted seawater is pumped back down and discharged close to the sea floor.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>But environmental and legal groups have urged caution, arguing there are potentially massive and unknown ramifications for the environment and for nearby communities, and that the global regulatory framework is not yet drafted. &#8216;Despite arising in the last half century, the &#8220;new global gold rush&#8221; of deep-sea mining shares many features with past resource scrambles &#8212; including a general disregard for environmental and social impacts, and the marginalisation of indigenous peoples and their rights,&#8217; a paper, written by Julie Hunter and Julian Aguon, from Blue Ocean Law, and Pradeep Singh, from the Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, Bremen, argues. The authors say that knowledge of the deep seabed remains extremely limited. &#8216;The surface of the Moon, Mars and even Venus have all been mapped and studied in much greater detail, leading marine scientists to commonly remark 299 that, with respect to the deep sea, &#8220;We don&#8217;t yet know what we need to know&#8221;.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>Scientific research &#8212; including a recent paper in Marine Policy journal &#8212; has suggested the deep seabed, and hydrothermal vents, which are created when seawater meets volcanic magma, have crucial impacts upon biodiversity and the global climate. The mineral-rich vents and their surrounds are also home to many well-known animals including crustaceans, tubeworms, clams, slugs, anemones and fish. &#8216;It is becoming increasingly clear that deepsea mining poses a grave threat to these vital seabed functions,&#8217; the paper says. &#8220;Extraction methods would produce large sediment plumes and involve the discharge of waste back into the ocean, significantly disturbing seafloor environments,&#8217; the paper continues. &#8216;On deep sea vents, scientists are clear,&#8217; says Dr Jon Copley of the National Oceanography Centre, Southampton: &#8216;we don&#8217;t want mining on them.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>The oceans occupy around 70% of the planet and are relatively unexplored, says Mike Johnston, chief executive of Nautilus, a Canadian underwater exploration company: &#8216;It makes sense to explore this untapped potential in an environmentally sustainable way, instead of continually looking at the fast depleting land resources of the planet to meet society&#8217;s rising needs.&#8217; Those leading the global rush to place giant mining machines thousands of metres below the sea surface say the environmental impacts will be far lower than on land. But critics say exotic and little-known ecosystems in the deep oceans could be destroyed and must be protected. &#8216;Mining will be the greatest assault on deep-sea ecosystems ever inflicted by humans,&#8217; according to hydrothermal vent expert Verena Tunnicliffe, at the University of Victoria in Canada. She argues that active vents must be off-limits for mining to protect the new knowledge and biotechnology spin-offs they can deliver, and that strict controls must be in place elsewhere.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Unselfish Gene</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><i>A psychologist gives his view on how humans became self-centred</i><br></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>There has long been a general assumption that human beings are essentially selfish. We're apparently ruthless, with strong impulses to compete against each other for resources and to accumulate power and possessions. If we are kind to one another, it&#8217;s usually because we have ulterior motives. If we are good, it&#8217;s only because we have managed to control and transcend our innate selfishness and brutality.<br></div><div><br></div><div>This bleak view of human nature is closely associated with the science writer Richard Dawkins, whose 1976 book The Selfish Gene became popular because it fitted so well with &#8212; and helped to justify &#8212; the competitive and individualistic ethos that was so prevalent in late 20th-century societies. Like many others, Dawkins justifies his views with reference to the field of evolutionary psychology. Evolutionary psychology theorises that present-day human traits developed in prehistoric times, during what is termed the &#8216;environment of evolutionary adaptedness&#8217;.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Prehistory is usually seen as a period of intense competition, when life was such a brutal battle that only those with traits such as selfishness, aggression and ruthlessness survived. And because survival depended on access to resources &#8212; such as rivers, forests and animals &#8212; there was bound to be conflict between rival groups, which led to the development of traits such as racism and warfare. This seems logical. But, in fact, the assumption on which this all rests &#8212; that prehistoric life was a desperate struggle for survival &#8212; is false.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It's important to remember that in the prehistoric era, the world was very sparsely populated. According to some estimates, around 15,000 years ago, the population of Europe was only 29,000, and the population of the whole world was less than half a million. Humans at that time were hunter-gatherers: people who lived by hunting wild animals and collecting wild plants. With such small population densities, it seems unlikely that prehistoric hunter-gatherer groups had to compete against each other for resources or had any need to develop ruthlessness and competitiveness, or to go to war.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There is significant evidence to back this notion from contemporary hunter-gatherer groups, who live in the same way as prehistoric humans did. As the anthropologist Bruce Knauft has remarked, hunter-gatherers are characterised by &#8216;extreme political and sexual egalitarianism&#8217;. Knauft has observed that individuals in such groups don&#8217;t accumulate properly or possessions and have an ethical obligation to share everything. They also have methods of preserving egalitarianism by ensuring that disparities of status don't arise.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The !Kung people of southern Africa, for example, swap arrows before going hunting and when an animal is killed, the acclaim does not go to the person who fired the arrow, but to the person the arrow belongs to. And if a person becomes too domineering, the other members of the group ostracise them, exiling the offender from society. Typically in such groups, men do not dictate what women do. Women in hunter-gatherer groups worldwide often benefit from a high level of autonomy, being able to select their own marriage partners, decide what work they do and work whenever they choose to. And if a marriage breaks down, they have custody rights over their children.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Many anthropologists believe that societies such as the /Kung were normal until a few thousand years ago, when population growth led to the development of agriculture and a Settled lifestyle. In view of the above, there seems little reason to assume that traits such as racism, warfare and male domination should have been selected by evolution &#8212; as they would have been of little benefit in the prehistoric era. Individuals who behaved selfishly and ruthlessly would be less likely to survive, since they would have been ostracised from their groups.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It makes more sense, then, to see traits such as cooperation, egalitarianism, altruism and peacefulness as innate characteristics of human beings. These were the traits that were prevalent in human life for tens of thousands of years. So presumably these traits are still strong in us now.<br></div><div><br></div><div>But if prehistoric life wasn&#8217;t really as brutal as has often been assumed, why do modern humans behave so selfishly and ruthlessly? Perhaps these negative traits should be seen as a later development, the result of environmental and psychological factors. Research has shown repeatedly that when the natural habitats of primates such as apes and gorillas are disrupted, they tend to become more violent and hierarchical.<br></div><div><br></div><div>So, it could well be that the same thing has happened to us. | believe that the end of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle and the advent of farming was connected to a psychological change that occurred in some groups of people. There was a new sense of individuality and separateness, which led to a new selfishness, and ultimately to hierarchical societies, patriarchy and warfare. At any rate, these negative traits appear to have developed so recently that it doesn&#8217;t seem feasible to explain them in adaptive or evolutionary terms.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>A History of the Telescope</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>The invention of the telescope played an important role in advancing our understanding of Earth&#8217;s place in the cosmos. While there is evidence that the principles of telescopes were known in the late 16th century, the first telescopes were created in the Netherlands in 1608, when spectacle makers Hans Lippershey and Zacharias Janssen, and Jacob Metius independently created telescopes.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>In 1609, Galileo Galilei became the first person to point a telescope skyward. Galileo&#8217;s telescope was the prototype of the modern day refractor telescope, which is one that uses a convex lens, which is fatter in the middle than at the ends. When parallel light rays pass through the lens, refraction causes the rays to converge. If the light rays entering the lens are all parallel, this meeting occurs at the focal point of the lens. In general, telescopic systems depend on how strongly the system converges or diverges light and so, in order to create greater magnification, it is necessary to increase the focal length.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>Although Galileo&#8217;s telescope was small and the images fuzzy, Galileo was able to make out mountains and craters on the moon, as well as a ribbon of diffused light arching across the sky, which would later be identified as our Milky Way galaxy. Galileo&#8217;s telescope had a magnification of about 10. The potential of this instrument for the army and commercial purposes so impressed the Venetian Senate that they funded the building of another larger one. This time, Galileo constructed a telescope with a magnification of about 20. Galileo then used this telescope to make a series of astronomical observations that stunned the scientific world. His use of the telescope to identify features of the moon was ground-breaking science in a couple of ways. Firstly, although Galileo was not the first person to study the heavens with a telescope, he was the first to do so in a systematic way and to record and interpret his observations and publish them for others to read. Secondly, Galileo demonstrated the usefulness of the telescope as an astronomical instrument that enhanced observation beyond what was possible with the unaided eye.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>A variation on the Galilean telescope was suggested by Johannes Kepler in 1611. He noted that a telescopic device could be built using two convex lenses, but the image it produced would be upturned. The advantage of this design, according to Kepler, was its larger field of view and high magnification. One disadvantage of Kepler&#8217;s astronomical telescope was that its higher magnification was accompanied by more spherical and chromatic aberration, which included&#160;geometric distortion and false colours. Over the next several decades, lens-grinding and -polishing techniques improved gradually and images produced by telescopes became much improved.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Paragraph E</div><div>By the beginning of the eighteenth century, a specialised craft community of telescope makers slowly developed. These craftsmen worked to produce better spherical lenses with decreased curvature and a longer focal length, which improved the quality of telescopes and made them longer. In addition, long refracting telescopes were rarely used any more. Further increases of power came, beginning in the mid-17th century, from a new form of telescope - the reflecting telescope. Instead of a lens, the reflecting telescope used mirrors, a single curved main one, together with a smaller flat one. This design turned out to be especially useful for studying very faint objects in space, such as the dim patches of light known as nebulae. The studies that the new and bigger tools made possible led to fundamental changes in people&#8217;s understanding of the universe.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>The nineteenth century saw an expanded scope for telescopes using refractive lenses and reflectors as the professional astronomer&#8217;s most important tools. As optical technology improved, the telescope became a rugged yet precise instrument. It was well suited for the research interests of scientists, who were mainly concerned with accurately measuring the positions and relative movements of stars, though just as important for cosmology was astronomers&#8217; gradual acceptance of astrophysics. Astronomers&#8217; desire for ever bigger telescopes caught the attention of wealthy American benefactors and by the end of the century, Americans boasted the two biggest telescopes in the world.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>The twentieth and twenty-first centuries saw the construction of telescopes that could produce images using wavelengths other than visible light, starting in 1931, when it was discovered that astronomical objects gave off radio emissions. This prompted a new era of observational astronomy after World War II, with telescopes being developed for other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum from radio to gamma-rays. Various different types of telescopes were developed, such as radio telescopes, infrared telescopes, ultraviolet telescopes and x-ray telescopes, gamma-ray telescopes and interferometric telescopes. Telescopes are also sometimes placed outside the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. From a position above the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, a telescope is able to detect light from stars, galaxies, and other objects in space before that light is absorbed or distorted by the atmosphere. Therefore, the view is a lot sharper than that from even the largest telescope on the ground.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph H</b></div><div>Telescopes have opened our eyes to the universe. Early telescopes showed that Earth was not the centre of the universe, as was previously believed. They also showed mountains and craters on the moon. Later telescopes have revealed geography and weather on the planets in our solar system. These instruments have also helped make the first valid measurement of the speed of light and they have also assisted us comprehend gravity and other fundamental laws of the physical world. The role of telescopes in understanding these things in better detail will continue to grow<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Forensic Handwriting Analysis</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>The forensic science discipline of handwriting examination and analysis initially surfaced as evidence in courts in around 1868, when a forged will was exposed. Over at least the last 150 years, many published scientific studies have focused on the individuality and reproducibility of handwriting for use in a forensic setting. The discipline primarily relies upon a trained handwriting examiner assessing the similarities of known and unknown samples in order to generate a conclusion.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Handwriting is a complex motor skill that is created by a combination of sensory, neurological, and physiological impulses. Factors such as visual perception and acuity, comprehension of form, central nervous system pathways, and the anatomy of the hand and arm all combine to produce the desired output.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Most people learn to write by copying letter formations from a copybook at a young age. The ability to reproduce these varies from one person to the next and is based on each writer&#8217;s perception of the shape and his or her ability to reproduce it. The act of handwriting is mastered through practice and repetition. Once this occurs, writers focus on the subject matter rather than the physical act of writing and deviate from the copybook forms, interjecting their own individualities. The writing becomes a pattern of the subconscious, and habits, which are repeated from one piece of writing to the next.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The comparison and evaluation of these individual features or habits enable forensic document examiners to identify or exclude, if possible, a known writer as the source for any questioned writing. Lay people may recognise the handwriting of an individual and differentiate between individuals to some degree; however, they observe only the gross features of the handwriting, such as letter formation, size, or slope of the handwriting. Lay people typically do not consider the subtleties in the writing that may differentiate it from other very similar writing. In contrast, document examiners analyse and can differentiate both the gross features and the less conspicuous elements in writing.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Handwriting features that examiners evaluate include pen pressure, pen lifts, the spacing between words and letters, the position of the writing on the baseline (the position of the character in relation to the ruled or imaginary line), height relationships, beginning and ending strokes, and line quality. A writer&#8217;s identity cannot be established through an individual feature in the writing. Rather, identity is established through a combination of the significant features between the writings, with no significant differences.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Not all handwriting is identifiable. For example, when a person traces another individual&#8217;s signature, that person imitates the writing habits of the original signer, and therefore, the imitator&#8217;s own handwriting characteristics are not manifested in the tracing. The forensic&#160;document examiner would be able to identify the writing as a tracing and associate the writing back to the model signature, if available, but would not be able to identify the writing with the person who traced the signature.<br></div><div><br></div><div>No one person writes exactly the same way, even within several repetitions of writings. This is known as natural variation, or intra-writer variation. Human beings are not capable of machinelike precision and repetition. As a result of the neuromuscular process, this variation in style is expected. Variation is an integral part of an individual&#8217;s writing. It describes the changes and deviations, often minute, that are found in repeated samples of one person&#8217;s writing. More specifically, variation refers to the different ways that a writer makes each letter or character. This variation is normal and serves as an added factor to personalise and individualise writing.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Handwriting examination is a sub-set of the forensic science discipline of questioned documents. Forensic document examiners conduct scientific examinations, comparisons, and analyses of documents in order to establish genuineness or non-genuineness, to reveal alterations, additions, or deletions, identify or eliminate persons as the source of handwriting, identify or eliminate the source of machine produced documents, typewriting, or other impression marks, or relative evidence, and preserve and/or restore legibility. Forensic document examiners help lawyers by examining and offering written opinions on a variety of disputed document problems including: wills, deeds, medical records, income tax records, time sheets, contracts, loan agreements, election petitions, checks, and anonymous letters.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Each analysis begins with an independent examination of the questioned and then the known writing using proper lighting and magnification to determine if the writing is original writing, for example ink on paper, and whether it exhibits the characteristics of freely and naturally prepared writing. Some of the characteristics of naturally prepared writing include consistent slant and size, thickening and thinning of the lines as the writing instrument changes direction, and tapered beginning and ending strokes that occur once the writing instrument comes into contact with or leaves the paper. Additionally, each body of writing is examined to assess internal consistency, comparability, and variation. The most suitable text for comparison is natural writing, void of any attempt to disguise and/or distort the writing; however, any writing can be of value for comparison.<br></div><div><br></div><div>As a discipline, forensic document examination has been consistently accepted in the judiciary in spite of court challenges. Published papers demonstrate the validity of the expertise and support the principle of handwriting individuality. Published criteria ensure consistency in methodology and document examiners in both public and private laboratories use these standards. Ongoing research continues to support the forensic document examination community in strengthening the scientific foundation for forensic handwriting analysis.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u><br></div><div><u><br></u></div><div>Acuity&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Sharpness of thought, vision, and/or hearing.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Lay&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Non professional or lacking expert knowledge<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Olive Oil</b><br><div><b><br></b></div><div>There seems to be a large base of anecdotal benefits that olive oil is good for people&#8217;s health. However, is this really true and does olive oil have any undesirable components? A lot of the controversy seems to stem from marketing battles between the producers of olive oil, butter and margarine.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Critics of olive oil point out that foods rich in monounsaturated fats like olive oil may be better than foods full of saturated and trans fats, but just because something is &#8216;better&#8217; does not mean it is good for you. Fats are fats, and too much of any can be harmful to the heart. Another problem with olive oil is its calorie count. Olive oil, like all oils and fats, are a concentrated source of calories. With over 4,000 calories per pound, olive oil is far more calorie dense than even pure refined sugar, which has 1,725 calories per pound. Because of its extremely high calorie density, adding olive oil to any food or meal will dramatically increase its calorie density. Therefore, consuming a lot of olive oil can cause poor heart health.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In spite of what the critics say, the Mediterranean diet, in which olive oil is the primary source of fat, has long been associated with a low mortality for cardiovascular disease and supporters of olive oil refer to the large body of knowledge providing evidence of the benefits of olive oil consumption with regards to the disease. Besides these classical benefits on the fat profile provided by olive oil consumption compared with that of saturated fat, a broad spectrum of other benefits on cardiovascular risk factors is now emerging associated with olive oil consumption. It has also been reported that olive oil intake could be beneficial in the prevention of certain cancers, such as breast cancer, but there is less evidence.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Extra-virgin olive oil is the oil with the best quality and the most intense taste. In contrast, common olive oil, obtained from a mixture of virgin and refined oil, usually more than 80 per cent refined, has fewer antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. Since during the refining process olive oil loses taste-enhancing polyphenols, refined oil is mixed with virgin olive oil to enhance the flavour; this makes what is called common olive oil. It appears that as extra-virgin olive oil contains much higher amounts of polyphenols than common olive oil, extra-virgin olive oil has better cardiovascular benefits.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The basic steps in making olive oil are always the same, no matter what kind of equipment is used, from small home presses to very large commercial mills built to process many tons of olives per hour. The first step in the oil extraction process is cleaning the olives and removing the stems, leaves, twigs, and other debris left with the olives. The olives should then be washed with water to remove toxic pesticides, dirt, and other debris. Rocks and sand will quickly wear out a centrifugal decanter or oil separator, reducing life span from 25 to as little as 5 years.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The second step is crushing the olives into a paste. The purpose of crushing is to tear the flesh cells to facilitate the release of the oil from the vacuoles. This step can be done with stone mills, metal tooth grinders, or various kinds of hammermills. Mixing the paste for 20 to 45 minutes allows small oil droplets to combine into bigger ones. It is an indispensable part of the process. The paste can be subjected to heat during this process to increase the yield, although this generally results in lowering the quality of the oil. The most common mixer is a horizontal trough with spiral mixing blades. Longer mixing times increase oil yield, but allow a longer oxidation period that decreases shelf life.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The next step consists of separating the oil from the rest of the olive components. This used to be done with presses, hence the now somewhat obsolete terms &#8216;first press&#8217; and &#8216;cold press&#8217; still used by marketers, but is now done by centrifugation, except in old facilities. Some centrifuges are called three-phase, because they separate the oil, the water, and the solids separately. In most cases, the oil coming out of the first centrifuge is further processed to eliminate any remaining water by a second centrifuge that rotates faster. The oil is then left so that a final separation, if needed, happens through gravity. This is called racking the oil. Finally, the oil can be filtered, if desired.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There has been a recent danger that has threatened the European olive oil industry. Xylella fastidiosa is a bacterium that attacks olive trees. This pathogen causes Olive Quick Decline Syndrome, a disease that initially causes withering and desiccation of terminal shoots, which then expand to the rest of the canopy, causing the tree to collapse and die. The majority of infections have occurred in old trees, which are less resistant to the bacteria than younger specimens. In a bid to control its spread, authorities of countries affected, such as Italy, Spain and Greece, have destroyed thousands of fruit trees. At the same time, in a bid to stop the spread of the disease to other countries, a ban has been imposed on the export of fruit or cuttings from susceptible species, such as olives, cherries, grapes and almonds, as well as ornamental fruits.<br></div><div><br></div><div>As a result of the pathogen, total world output of olive oil last year had a one-third decrease from the previous year. Due to the severe drop in supply, world olive oil prices surged in Italy and Spain, the two countries that account for 70 per cent of global output.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u><br></div><div><br></div><div>Vacuole&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A small space containing fluid within a cell.<br></div>",

That is the question.</b><div><b>A return to dairy products</b><div></div></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>A</b></div><div>At no time in history has the world&#8217;s population ever been so well-informed about nutrition and health. Consumers in the developed world are constantly bombarded with advertising messages which promote the health benefits of a wide range of food products. However, they are also exposed to the constant promotion of junk food as well. Fast food companies have become sensitive to the criticisms they face over the potential damage their food causes and have begun to vigorously defend the nutritional value of the meals they serve. With this constant flow of messages &#8211; often contradictory &#8211; how are today&#8217;s consumers supposed to determine precisely what is healthy to eat?<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>According to nutritionist Susan McCaskill, many people today intend to eat healthily, but have become confused about how to do so. &#8220;It is not just that the traditional definitions of a healthy diet have changed, though this is certainly significant. Many grew up being told that the more milk you drank, the healthier you would be. Then dairy foods became &#8216;bad&#8217; in the eyes of many health professionals and many people sought alternatives to it. Now these alternatives are coming under the same sort of criticism.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>The alternative McCaskill is referring to is soya milk. A generation of consumers who were labelled allergic to cow&#8217;s milk products embraced soya substitutes enthusiastically. In fact, the soya bean itself was promoted as a kind of miracle food overall. Claims were made it had the potential to not only provide all the protein required for a healthy diet, but that it could prevent heart disease and cancer. Slogans such as &#8220;It&#8217;s Soy Good for you...&#8221; began to appear in nutritional advice columns.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>Now suddenly you can find messages on health-related websites claiming &#8220;It&#8217;s not soy good&#8221; and even &#8220;It&#8217;s SOY bad for you.&#8221; A generation of health-conscious eaters who previously abandoned milk products for soy are now worried and confused. The same chemicals (known as isoflavones) in soya beans which were claimed to fight cancer and other diseases are now listed as the cause of some cancers, and are also implicated in hormonal problems and thyroid gland disorders. Dr David Steinman of the Eastern Sydney University Medical School considers the praise of soya products in many alternative health circles to be without scientific foundation. &#8220;Soya proponents suggest we look to the health statistics of Asian countries as proof of the benefits of soy. When we look closely at the countries where soya products are consumed regularly, it is clear that though they are widely used, they are also eaten in very moderate quantities. Many people seeking a healthy diet today are eating ten times that much soy, particularly through drinking vast amounts of soya milk and eating other non-traditional foods such as soya-based ice-cream.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>Susan McCaskill considers the latest negative publicity about soy to be exaggerated, but she admits that it does raise some very relevant questions. &#8220;It still appears to me that soya beans have many notable nutritional benefits to offer, but the key thing here is moderation. What frequently happens now is that people go from eating much too much of one thing to eating too much of something else.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>Both McCaskill and Steinman concede that the recent soya controversy is just one example of how food fashions are confusing the health-conscious today. Red meat has often been blamed for high rates of heart disease and other health problems, then has been praised for its high iron content. Carbohydrate rich foods such as pasta, rice and potatoes have been promoted since the seventies as healthy staples of our diet, and then recently have received the blame for the growing numbers of people who are seriously overweight.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>G</b></div><div>Dr Steinman echoes the words of McCaskill on one key point - moderation is the most significant factor in any healthy diet. However, he fears that modern obsessions with perfect food habits can simply leave people so discouraged that they give up completely. &#8220;If you rush to a new diet because you&#8217;ve been told your old one was bad, then find the new one has its own critics, what do you do next? I worry that many will simply stop thinking about healthy eating habits and head to the nearest fast food outlet.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>H</b></div><div>It is certainly undeniable that the fast food industry is booming. Whether this is because of confused and discouraged eaters of health food is difficult to determine. What is clear, however, is that advertisers are working harder and harder to influence the world&#8217;s eating habits, and that the needs of both health enthusiasts and fast food customers are now coming together: the fastest growing customer base in many major fast food chains is now people attracted by their new &#8220;healthy choices.&#8221; The question remains: who will decide in the end precisely what a healthy choice is?<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Panama Canal</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>A</b></div><div>The Panama Canal is an artificial waterway that connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. It is a major conduit for maritime trade. Prior to its opening in 1914, ships travelling between the east and west coasts of the United States had been obliged to round Cape Horn at the tip of South America. Passage through the canal shortens this voyage by around 15,000 kilometres. The Panama Canal is still dwarfed by the world&#8217;s other great artificial waterway, the Suez Canal, which measures 193 kilometres from one end to the other. The Panama Canal is 111 kilometres shorter than its counterpart in Egypt, at 82 kilometres.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>The Panama Canal uses locks to lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial lake that was created to reduce the amount of excavation required to build the canal, and then lower them back down to sea level at the other end. A ship takes an average of 25 hours to negotiate the canal from one end to the other, though this includes waiting time. Once tolls have been paid and important papers inspected by officials, a ship can begin its transit of the canal itself, which usually takes around 10 hours. Smaller craft are permitted to move through the locks unassisted, but larger ones must at this point be attached to locomotives that run along tracks on the walls of the lock. These serve to keep the vessel centred in the lock and prevent any contact with the lock itself. Local pilots with extensive experience navigating the canal board the vessel and slowly move it forward into the first chamber. The locks essentially function like elevators. The first chamber is sealed off by closing the lock gates behind the ship, and operators then allow water to flow in. The adjacent chamber supplies this water, which raises the level of the ship, allowing it to move forward. The system relies not on machinery but gravity to move water from one chamber to the next. This process continues until the ships reaches the level of Gatun Lake, and is then repeated in reverse at the other end.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>The first attempt to construct a canal through the then-Colombian province of Panama began in 1881 when the Colombian government granted a concession to a privately owned French company. Under the leadership of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the company was able to raise capital from small investors because of de Lesseps&#8217; previous success building the Suez Canal in Egypt. Even though the Panama Canal only needed to be half the length of the Suez Canal, the project was significantly more challenging. The French eventually abandoned the project in 1889, by which time around 22,000 workers had lost their lives.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>The United States formally took control of the canal property in 1904. This was following the passage of the Spooner Act by Congress in 1902, which authorised the purchase of the French company&#8217;s assets and construction of the canal, provided that a treaty could be negotiated with Colombia. When treaty negotiations broke down, Panama, with the backing of the United States, declared its independence, which allowed the Hay&#8211;Bunau- Varilla Treaty to be negotiated between the United States and Panama. As a newly established republic, Panama was seeking the protection of the United States, which the United States was willing to guarantee in exchange for control of a 16-kilometre strip across the Isthmus of Panama. The United States also agreed to pay Panama an initial sum of $10 million, as well as a $250,000 annuity that would begin nine years after the opening of the canal.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>There were challenges during construction, but the Americans made solid progress, and the canal was finally opened to traffic in 1914. The United States retained sole control of the canal and the surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the signing of the Torrijos&#8211; Carter Treaties in 1977. These treaties provided for the handover of the canal to Panama, which would not be completely realised until 1999. The canal was initially administered by the Panama Canal Commission, a joint US&#8211;Panama agency set up to manage the canal in the intervening years. The canal is now administered by the Panama Canal Authority, which was set up in 1997 in preparation for the handover.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>Despite having enjoyed a privileged position for many years, the Panama Canal is facing increasing competition from other routes. Much of this competition comes from the Suez Canal, which, despite being half a world away, is often seen as a viable alternative route for cargo being transported from Asia to the US East Coast. This is partly because of its lower tolls, but also because it can more easily accommodate larger ships. As a sea-level canal, locks were not needed and construction was more straightforward, which meant they were able to build a relatively wide canal to accommodate fully laden ships up to 50 metres wide. The Panama Canal could originally handle ships with a width of up to 32.31 metres, but in order to retain the market share it was losing to other routes, including the Suez Canal, a project to build a third set of locks was begun in 2007. Completed in 2015, these locks now allow ships up to 51.25 metres wide to pass through the canal, but the maximum vessel height remains unchanged at 57.91 metres due to the need to fit under the Bridge of the Americas, which spans the Pacific entrance to the canal.<br></div>",

Do you struggle day to day just to stay calm and clear-headed in the face of more and more frustrating experiences? If your answer to these questions is &#8220;YES,&#8221; you are not alone. In fact, you are part of a growing trend that demonstrates the significance of the small events which annoy us on a day to day basis.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>According to psychologist Maurice Penman, inhabitants of today&#8217;s modern cities face a far more aggressive range of sensory experiences than ever before. &#8220;It is not simply that the pace of life is faster in today&#8217;s world, or that people are under more pressure at work. Of course, both those things are true. But today people are exposed to a greater number of both visual and auditory stimuli. Basically, this means we are being asked to both look at and listen to far more than we ever have been before.&#34;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>However, Penman is quick to point out that many of the things which are contributing to these problems are also the same things many of us value. A greater sense of irritation is the price we pay for the convenience of the Internet and mobile phones. &#8220;Mobile phones are a very significant example to consider. There is no doubt that they are useful in a multitude of ways, and most people do not want to go back to the days before them. But at the same time, mobile phones have almost completely destroyed a sense of quiet public space. There was a time when you could rely on public transport being relatively quiet, a place to think about the events of the day on the way home. Now a bus or a train carriage can feel like being locked in a busy office.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>The increase in sensory demands is not just due to the use of mobile phones. Advertisers are reaching out to potential consumers more aggressively than ever. News services are now broadcast on buses and at train platforms. Family meals are frequently interrupted by telephone canvassers and email users are often forced to deal with an avalanche of unsolicited promotional messages, or &#8220;SPAM&#8221;. One could easily imagine that our children and their children may have to guard their homes from an overwhelming amount of annoyance.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>While it is difficult to deny the growth in these increasingly annoying events in our day, is there actually any real significance to these facts? Penman argues: &#8220;There is no doubt that on the surface, this increase of stimuli in our day simply appears to be a matter of minor annoyance. But when we look closely, we can see that this has the potential to significantly affect our psychological health.&#8221; He goes on to explain that if exposure to these irritations is frequent and prolonged, very subtly our stress levels begin to rise. As they do, we find there is a compound effect. Stress from the minor episodes in the day starts to increase our feeling of pressure when faced with major challenges at work. We are increasingly carrying a greater and greater stress load, with opportunities to relax and unwind more and more restricted. Penman points out that even though we all sometimes crave stimulation, we have become so obsessed with it in the twenty-first century that it has now become almost impossible to avoid. Shops increasingly feel the need to play loud, thumping rock or techno music. Advertising becomes more and more energetically aggressive all the time. This, Penman maintains, prevents us from dealing with our daily stress and eliminating it from our systems. He adds: &#8220;You really do need to get right out of the city and into a quiet space now, though most of us are too busy to do that very often.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>It might be easy for critics to dismiss the annoying experience of too many mobile phones on the bus, or any of the other stimuli Maurice Penman cites. However, it is the failure to eliminate stress which leads to potentially fatal consequences. If these daily distractions are contributing seriously to our stress levels, then Penman has identified a significant danger. We now know that stress truly is a killer, and has been implicated in the rise of depression, heart disease and even weight problems, as it increases hormones in the body which stimulate the appetite for fattening carbohydrate-rich foods.<br></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>G</b></span></div><div><span>There is no denying that Maurice Penn's main arguments are compelling. It seems that stress has become so prevalent that people are getting stressed about their levels of stress. But what are we supposed to do? He suggests we do everything we can to go within ourselves and try to maintain a sense of personal peace and space. He recommends the use of meditation and relaxation tapes, exercise at the end of the day whenever possible and greater emphasis on fun. Unfortunately, Maurice Penman had no suggestions for those of us who find meditation frustrating, or who get annoyed at relaxation tapes. He had no recommendations for days when you can&#8217;t find any equipment you need in the gym, or find yourself irritated at those around you who keep saying you need to have more fun.</span><br></div>",

Over the last few decades, two large sections of the ice shelf (Larsen A and B) have collapsed. In 2017, the third section (Larsen C) calved, sending what might be one of the largest icebergs ever recorded slipping into a sea frosted with smaller chunks of ice. It marked the end of a decade-long splintering first seen by satellites in the 1960s. The massive Larsen C iceberg holds twice as much water as the amount used in the United States every year. It weighs about 1.1 trillion tons, measures 2,200 square miles and its volume is twice that of Lake Erie. Its future progress is difficult to predict. It may stay in one piece, but it is more likely to break into fragments. Some of the ice may stay in the area for decades, while parts of the iceberg may drift north into warmer waters.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>Ice shelves fringe 75 per cent of the Antarctic ice sheet. One way to assess the health of ice sheets is to look at their balance: when an ice sheet is in balance, the ice gained through snowfall equals the ice lost through melting and iceberg calving. Even relatively large calving events, where enormous ice chunks calve from the seaward front of the shelf, can be considered normal if the ice sheet is in overall balance. But sometimes, ice sheets destabilise, either through the loss of a particularly big iceberg or through disintegration of an ice shelf. When floating ice shelves disintegrate, they reduce the resistance to glacial flow and thus allow the grounded glaciers they were buttressing to significantly dump more ice into the ocean.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>It was during the Southern Hemisphere summer of 2002 that scientists monitoring the Antarctic Peninsula watched in amazement as almost the entire Larsen B Ice Shelf splintered and collapsed into Larsen Bay in just over one month. They had never witnessed such a large area &#8211; 3,250 square kilometers, or 1,250 square miles &#8211; disintegrate so rapidly. While the collapse of the Larsen B was unprecedented in terms of scale, it was not the first ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula to experience an abrupt break up. The northernmost section of the Larsen Ice Shelf Complex, called Larsen A, lost about 1,500 square kilometers of ice in an abrupt event in January 1995.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>The collapse of much of the Larsen Ice Shelves into Larsen Bay appears to have been due to a series of warm summers on the Antarctic Peninsula, one of the symptoms of global warming. Average annual temperatures on Antarctica&#8217;s west side have risen nearly 5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1950, several times faster than the rest of the planet, and the winters have warmed an astonishing 9 degrees. Most of the heat trapped by our fossil fuel emissions since the industrial revolution began in the nineteenth century has gone into the ocean. In addition, circumpolar winds have driven seawater that has risen in temperature from offshore onto the continental shelf and under the floating ice shelves. Significant surface melting of ice due to warm air temperatures have created melt ponds in the ice shelves that have acted like wedges; they deepened the crevasses and eventually caused the shelf to splinter. As the surface melt ponds began to fracture the shelf, strong winds and waves flexed the shelf, helping to trigger a runaway break up. The ice debris field did not become a permanent fixture in Larsen Bay. As seasonal sea ice melted the following summer, the ice began to drift away with the currents, and in many summers since the collapses, the bay has been completely ice free.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>The loss of part of the Larsen Ice Shelf has one specific effect. Although the collapse of any floating ice shelf does not directly add to sea level, even after it&#8217;s absorbed into the sea, the removal of buttressing restraints by the ice shelves may &#8216;unplug&#8217; land-based glaciers behind the former ice shelves, and these can then flow more rapidly into the sea, causing ocean levels to rise significantly. Following the collapse of the Larsen A and B ice shelves, the Larsen A and B glaciers experienced abrupt acceleration, about 300 per cent on average, and they suffered mass reduction. In some regions, sea ice can assist to stabilise vulnerable ice shelf margins, but global warming has caused the loss of this in polar coastal regions. Although sea ice occasionally occupies Larsen Bay during cold winters, it is no substitute for the ice shelf in terms of its influence on the Larsen glaciers. The grounded portion of the shelf used to push back against the glaciers, slowing them down. Without this pushback, the glaciers that fed the ice sheet have accelerated and thinned.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>The calving of the ice shelves is just the warning, as they signal that a significant rise in the level of the seas is imminent, due to the glaciers behind them accelerating. This may not be important for people over the next 30 to 40 years, but in the second half of the twenty-first century, things could really escalate to create a really hazardous world, and at that point listening to scientists&#8217; warnings is too late.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Role of the Zoo</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>There are not many people in the world who haven&#8217;t visited a zoo or safari park in their lifetime. Not only is a trip to the zoo a fun day out, it is a chance for many people to get relatively close to animals they are unlikely to see elsewhere. Most people nowadays recognise that not all zoos are considered equal: there are both &#8216;good&#8217; and &#8216;bad&#8217; zoos. Most of us would agree that the stereotypical roadside zoos known for their negligence of animals are in the &#8216;bad&#8217; category, while we would expect zoos in developed countries to maintain higher standards of animal welfare and be among the &#8216;good&#8217; ones. To say that all zoos are bad, however, is a blunt and sweeping indictment and the judgement fails to account for how ethical institutions enrich and ultimately protect the lives of animals, both in human care and in the wild.</div><div><br></div><div>The role of the zoo has evolved to prioritise research, education, and conservation. Some people still condemn the existence of zoos based on zoos&#8217; past life of pure entertainment and it is true that zoos started as menageries and amusement parks. However, zoos have come a long way since the late 1800s and the current legislation protecting wild animals and guaranteeing their welfare make sure zoos and aquariums are a better place for animals to live.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Zoos have an essential role in conservation, as biologist Tom Compton asserts. &#8220;Given trends regarding the disappearance of various animals, the number of species requiring conservation breeding programs is likely to increase dramatically. Today&#8217;s zoos and aquariums are uniquely positioned to combat the evolving dangers threatening nature. Using robust and sophisticated breeding plans, these institutions fund and facilitate countless initiatives to propagate endangered animals and preserve genetic biodiversity, and then reintroduce critically endangered or extinct species into the wild.&#8221; Currently, most zoos in developed countries have their own breeding programs and all efforts in captive breeding have led to increased research. As researcher Jake Potter puts it, &#8220;many zoos have become places of rigorous scientific research. This is coupled with an active effort not just to preserve in captivity those creatures that are endangered in the wild, but to understand, save, and replenish unique natural habitats.&#8221; The benefits of zoos have been underestimated. Zookeepers, researchers, and vets now know a lot more about husbandry as zoos have evolved, and these improvements have led to increased longevity of animals in captivity and in their natural habitats.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The role of zoos in public education is also very significant. Resident zoo educator Anne Paisley points out that this is in turn important to conservation. &#8220;Zoos need to assign equal weight to teaching people and especially children about the threats that modern society offers to wildlife as they do to the entertainment value that zoos provide as a family day out. The children of today will be the ones who make decisions over conservation tomorrow.&#8221; Zookeeper Tony Wilde also emphasises the importance of people seeing the animals as individuals rather than an idea from a book or television programme. &#8220;The public visiting a zoo sees many kinds of animal. Each species conforms to a set pattern, often based on facts gleaned at school. Elephants are just elephants; lions are just lions; bears are just bears. What the visitor often does not realize is that each animal is also an individual. All my zoo elephants are different to each other, and each one leaves me with a different memory.&#8221; Not everyone agrees that zoos fulfil this educational function, though. Peter Grant, the zoo critic, believes that &#8220;the zoo&#8217;s contribution to education is minimal and that most people show no more than casual curiosity about its animals. If zoos are teaching children anything, it&#8217;s that imprisoning animals for our own entertainment is acceptable.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>The main argument against zoos is the belief that, even with the best intentions and conditions, a zoo cannot provide the perfect environment for every type of animal. For example, it is extremely difficult for zoos to recreate the natural environment that an elephant is used to living in. This is because in the course of a day, an elephant can walk anywhere up to 50 kilometres. Elephants also travel in packs of thirty or forty in the wild. In most zoos, elephants will usually have just several acres to walk around in and maybe a couple of other elephants, if they are lucky.<br></div><div><br></div><div>People against animals being kept in zoos are also unimpressed with the attempts to create an animal friendly habitat for each occupant. Activist Pia Lundstrom argues that &#8220;zoo enclosures, while attractive and a vast improvement on the past, are rarely big enough and do not prevent the animals from becoming depressed.&#8221; She goes on to argue that &#8220;by making animals live in artificial surroundings, the zoo is messing with natural mating activities, which can cause zoochosis in the animal, which is similar to the human Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.&#8221; Another problem is privacy, because the animals are living in habitats that are often extremely smaller than they are used to, the animal cannot enjoy much needed seclusion. This can also cause depression and obsessive behaviour in the animals.<br></div><div><br></div><div>There is no denying that the animals kept in zoos discussion is controversial, as both sides of the argument make valid points. However, global change represents an unprecedented challenge for the maintenance of biodiversity. It is expected that even under the most optimistic impact and adaptation scenarios, a great number of species may require the integration of a suite of wildlife preservation actions, including conservation breeding programs in zoos.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Leadership Theory</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>For decades, leadership theories have been the source of numerous studies. In reality as well as in practice, many have tried to define what allows authentic leaders to stand apart from the mass. Hence, there are as many theories on leadership as there are philosophers, researchers and professors.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Two early theories in particular that emerged in the nineteenth century were &#8216;great man&#8217; theory, which argued that great leaders are born, not made, and later trait theory, which argues certain characteristics and attributes are peculiar to leaders. &#8216;Great man&#8217; theorists see history as shaped by the leadership of great men, and these theorists look at the &#8216;great man&#8217; as being either possessed of divinely given features from which the masses in his proximity profited or having a hereditary background that transmitted natural ability to the extent that it is possible to identify the probability of an eminent person having eminent relatives. The lasting impact of &#8216;great man&#8217; leadership can still be observed over a century later, where responsibility for having the answer to some of the world&#8217;s most complex problems are placed on the shoulders of individuals, such as presidents, prime ministers and CEOs. Subsequent to the &#8216;great man&#8217; theorists, researchers from the early to mid-twentieth century focused on traits of personality to explain leadership and sought to identify those characteristics peculiar to leaders. Bird&#8217;s 1940 list of 79 relevant traits, taken from 20 psychologically oriented studies, demonstrates the extent to which traits were considered quantifiable and foreseeable. Intelligence, drive, integrity and sociability were central to the lists of almost all the researchers studying trait leadership.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Although the &#8216;great man&#8217; theory and trait theory were criticised for their lack of scientific basis in the nineteenth century, the examination of traits individually and in combination did not fall into general disfavour until the middle of the twentieth century. Paving the way for later studies, the psychologist Stogdill concluded that the qualities, characteristics, and skills required of a leader are determined to a large extent by the demands of the situation and that an adequate analysis of leadership involves a study not only of leaders, but also of situations. Stogdill also touched on the relevance of group around a leader&#8217;s emergence and effectiveness, concluding that a person does not become a leader by virtue of some combination of traits; but that the pattern of personal attributes of the leader must bear some relevant relationship to the characteristics, activities, and goals of those around him. The connection between leaders and their followers would also form part of later thinking.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The relationship between leaders and followers was central to the theories that emerged as trait theory fell into disfavour. The most prominent of these are the situational leadership theory and the contingency model of decision making. The 1969 situational leadership theory was based on an interpretation of existing empirical research. Researchers proposed that different leadership styles are employed depending on the situation, as defined by both the orientation of the manager, who can be either task or relations focused, and the maturity or experience of the employee. In this model, the most effective leadership matches the leader&#8217;s orientation with the subordinate&#8217;s maturity, beginning with directing newly appointed or less experienced employees in their tasks, then coaching employees with more experience, through to supporting, where managers engage employees&#8217; maturity and knowledge to complete tasks. The final style is delegating, which recognises that fully mature subordinates work best when leaders delegate what needs to be done.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The contingency theory was based on rigorous deduction and support from controlled empirical studies and experiments to develop a model to assist leaders to determine the most effective approach to decision making. The model suggests the leadership decision style most conducive to effectiveness depends on the characteristics of the situation, and on whether a balance is achieved between a high-quality decision and a positive response to the decision by subordinates. Leaders work through a series of questions resulting in a recommended decision-making style ranging from directive to consultative, and on to participative decision making. A final style, delegative, was added later.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Both the situational leadership and the contingency models have been challenged. The situational leadership model has been criticised because of the lack of internal consistency of its measures, its conceptual contradictions, and its ambiguities, and that the model appears to have no theoretical or logical justification. The contingency model has been criticised as it was judged to be detrimental to a group&#8217;s efficiency and subordinates&#8217; job satisfaction. Critics acknowledged that the contingency model was solely potentially helpful as a tool for weighing up situational factors to find an appropriate decision making approach.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Finally, the 1970&#8217;s and 1980&#8217;s saw the emergence of transactional leadership and transformational leadership theories. Transactional leadership describes a relationship in which the leader initiates an exchange of valued things that motivate and bind followers to the leader. At its most basic, transactional leadership is the swap of recompense for labour, with the rewards being psychological or material in nature. Transactional leadership also promotes the concept of a lack of compliance being penalised. Transformational leadership, on the other hand, originates in the personal values and beliefs of leaders, not in an exchange of commodities between leaders and followers. Proponents of transformational leadership claim that rather than leading with only a transformational leadership style or a transactional leadership style, the transformational leadership approach can augment the effects of transactional leadership and even other approaches.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Blue Sharks</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>The blue shark inhabits a great diversity of areas around the world. It dwells in temperate, tropical and subtropical waters up to 350 meters deep and is found near all coasts except those of Antarctica. It concentrates mainly in latitudes between 20 degrees and 50 degrees north and likes waters with temperatures of between 7 degrees and 16 degrees centigrade, although it can tolerate warmer temperatures slightly above 21 degrees Celsius. It likes approaching shores, where divers and boats see it often. The blue shark inhabits the shallower zones near the coasts and the continental shelves, but if it dwells in tropical waters, then it tends to be found in deeper waters.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>The blue shark is a carnivorous predator that feeds on about 24 species of cephalopods and 16 species of fish. Its diet includes octopus, squid, mackerel, tunas, lobsters, crabs, small sharks and occasionally seabirds. They usually seek to catch small prey, but if they find large mammal carrion, it will become part of their food. The blue shark surrounds its prey before attacking it. When needed, it joins with other sharks of the same species and cooperates to attack larger prey and facilitate its capture. Its swimming speed and its triangular teeth help the shark to tear the skin and flesh of the most complicated of animals. Because it is rather easily excited by the presence of almost anything perceived as prey, the blue shark has made some attacks on people, establishing notoriety amongst divers. As in other shark species, there are rows of teeth present, each row being in a progressively different stage of development. As the front teeth fall out or break, new ones replace them from the next row.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>Many sharks are solitary, but blue sharks live in small groups called schools. Some of these groups consist only of females and others consist only of males. Within each group, there is a certain order, with the largest member often being the leader of the group. They travel in these groups for protection and they also often hunt in groups.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>Blue Sharks are highly migratory with complex movement patterns and spatial structure related to reproduction and the distribution of prey. There tends to be a seasonal shift in population abundance to higher latitudes associated with oceanic convergence or boundary zones, as these are areas of higher productivity. Tagging studies of blue sharks have demonstrated extensive movements in the Atlantic with numerous trans-Atlantic migrations, which are accomplished by utilising current systems. The blue shark is a slow-swimming animal that increases its speed when stimulated by external factors, such as the presence of animals on which it can feed. If this happens, it then becomes one of the fastest fish.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>The blue shark reaches reproductive maturity at around 5 or 6 years old, after which it can reproduce through viviparity. The blue shark migrates northward to deliver their offspring and, after mating, both mother and father separate and do not join again, since this species is polygamous. Reproduction has been reported as seasonal in most areas, with the young often born in spring or summer, although the periods of ovulation and parturition may be extended. After a gestation period lasting between 9 and 12 months, the female gives birth to a large number of offspring. An unusual case was a mother that had 130 pups, but the average amount ranges between 25 and 50. The newborns soon separate from their mother who does not provide any parental care.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>The most significant challenge faced by the blue shark is that of fishing, as millions of individual animals are caught every year, mainly as bycatch in long-line and trawl fisheries. The fins are used for consumption and the skin for leather and leather products. The oil produced in the liver for buoyancy is also in high demand. After death, the meat is rapidly contaminated by secreted ammonia and so is not widely valued. Landed carcasses can be processed for fishmeal, but loopholes in EC legislation mean that many are still discarded at sea. Fisheries catch data assessments suggest a 60 per cent decline of blue shark populations in the northwest Atlantic, and declines have been observed elsewhere in this range. Better monitoring of these fisheries is needed to determine Atlantic trends, as there are real concerns about the impacts of the removal of so many animals from the ecosystem. The blue shark is also the target of sports fishing in the United States, Australia and some parts of Europe, though sharks are usually released unharmed after capture. As a consequence of all this, the blue shark is &#8216;Near Threatened&#8217;, according to the Red List of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Blue sharks also have a few predators, including larger sharks such as the mako and the great white. They are also eaten by sea lions and seals, which eat just their stomach and liver.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>International obligations that regulate the fishing of sharks include the United Nations, the International Plan of Action for Sharks, and the U.S. Sustainable Fisheries Act. Although some countries have banned finning, there are no binding international treaties for the management of sharks, including the regulation or outlawing of finning. The blue shark is listed on Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea, which stresses the need for international cooperation in the conservation, management and utilisation of living aquatic resources, especially of migratory species. This does not, however, enforce any regulations. Fortunately, the blue shark is a prolific species and its distribution offers a reasonable buffer against total removal from the ecosystem.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u><br></div><div><u><br></u></div><div>Viviparity</div><div>The ability to give birth to live young that have already reached an advanced stage&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; of development.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Gestation</div><div>The state of being pregnant; the period from conception to birth.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Dyscalculia</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Dyscalculia is defined as difficulty in acquiring basic arithmetic skills that is not explained by low intelligence or inadequate schooling. About 5 per cent of children in primary schools are affected, which is a relatively constant figure across the countries of the world. Children with dyscalculia are likely to struggle in maths lessons, which often leads to anxiety and low self-esteem. Numeracy problems impact more negatively on job prospects than literacy problems, so dyscalculia is very likely to affect people into adulthood.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Dyscalculia is often associated with mental disorders, but the causes of it are not clearly understood. There is, however, evidence to suggest that dyscalculia may have a genetic component. If one identical twin has the condition, there is a chance of around 70 per cent that the other twin will also be dyscalculic. For non-identical twins, who have less genetic material in common than identical twins, yet also share the same environment, this chance is lower, at around 55 per cent.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Difficulty in learning arithmetic, like difficulty in learning to read and write, is a common learning disorder in childhood. Many affected children acquire a negative approach to counting and arithmetic, which, in turn, often develops into a specific mathematics anxiety or even a generalised school phobia. Unless specifically treated, dyscalculia persists into adulthood and it can lastingly impair personality development, schooling, and occupational training. Dyscalculia is also an economic issue, as adults with poor arithmetic skills suffer a major disadvantage in the job market. The mental disorders commonly associated with dyscalculia are expensive to treat. Thus, the early recognition and differential identification of learning disorders are an important matter, not just for child psychiatrists, who must often deal with the secondary conditions that arise from these disorders, but also for general practitioners and pediatricians, as the delayed acquisition of prescholastic skills in the nursery and kindergarten years may already be an early sign of a problem.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The process of developing number skills requires some knowledge of cognitive neuroscience. Functional imaging studies have shown that, with increasing practice and expertise, number skills are centred in multiple brain areas. Number-words are processed in the speech areas of the left brain region and Arabic numerals in the back of the brain. Basic numerical representations and the numerical-spatial representations that develop later on are processed on both sides of the brain, and these latter processes become increasingly functionally specialised as a child grows older and acquires more education. The development and maturation in children of these domain-specific brain functions depends on the maturation of numerous domain-specific or multi-domain functions, including attention and working memory language, sensorimotor function and visuospatial ideation. This development also depends on a child&#8217;s learning over time and the type of teaching methods used on the child. Clearly, at any time in a child&#8217;s development, many different factors could disturb or delay the maturation of these neural networks, causing clinically evident manifestations of various kinds, including dyscalculia.<br></div><div><br></div><div>When dyscalculia is suspected, a detailed diagnostic evaluation is needed in order to take proper account of the complexity of this learning disorder and to produce an accurate picture of the affected child&#8217;s particular strengths and weaknesses in the area of numbers and calculations. The diagnostic instruments used for this purpose are of two main types: the curricular and the neuropsychological. As the affected children often perform far below grade level on numerical and calculating tasks, the use of curricular tests related to grade alone may not yield a complete picture of the actual performance deficit. This can, in turn, lead to inappropriate interventions with little promise of efficacy, because the child&#8217;s performance is not really at the level for which the intervention was designed.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Some experts have questioned whether it is practical from an educational point of view to distinguish dyscalculic people from others with low maths ability. Others suggest that such differentiation is important because dyscalculic people need training on very simple number concepts which other people, including those who have low maths ability for other reasons, take for granted.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The effective treatment of dyscalculia demands special expertise, which is most likely to be found among graduates of specialised training, and continuing-education programs that have been certified by recognised professional associations. Recently, bachelor&#8217;s and master&#8217;s degree programs for specific training in learning therapy targeting dyscalculia have been initiated at universities and professional training institutes. Learning therapies can be carried out either in school, in conjunction with school, or outside school. As a rule, interventions can succeed only when they are ecologically valid, i.e., when they can take effect in the setting of the child&#8217;s everyday life. A further role for the treating physician or psychologist may be to point out that an established legal framework exists (dependent on country) for giving the affected persons special means to compensate for their learning difficulty in situations calling for high performance, including situations where their performance will be evaluated. Whatever opportunities of this kind are available should be tried out in the individual case and made use of where appropriate.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In summary, the main roles of the treating pediatrician or family physician centres are on the early recognition of dyscalculia and directing the child&#8217;s parents and other carers towards appropriate counseling regarding diagnostic and therapeutic measures. Early recognition largely depends on information provided by the child&#8217;s parents or other carers. Depending on the age of the child, specific questions should be asked about his or her understanding of quantity, counting skills, and mathematical performance in school to date. The history should also include questions about any secondary disturbances that might be present, for example, dislike of school, mathematics anxiety, and school phobia.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u><br></div><div><u><br></u></div><div>Visuospatial<br></div><div>Relating to or denoting the visual perception of the spatial relationships of objects.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Ideation<br></div><div>The formation of ideas or concepts.<br></div>",

          "content": "<div>Product placement is the purposeful incorporation of commercial content into noncommercial settings, that is, a product plug generated via the fusion of advertising and entertainment. While product placement is riskier than conventional advertising, it is becoming a common practice to place products and brands into mainstream media, including films, broadcast and cable television programs, computer and video games, blogs, music videos/DVDs, magazines, books, comics, Broadway musicals and plays, radio, Internet, and mobile phones. To reach retreating audiences due to increasing ways of avoiding television advertising, advertisers increasingly use product placements in clever and effective ways that do not cost too much money.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Marketing practices raise a number of familiar issues. At a macro-level, there are issues of sustainability and waste of resources through over-consumption. Marketing, and especially marketing communication, are often implicated in such arguments on the basis that their activities encourage over-consumption by fostering greed and materialism. Since marketing operates at the hub of the wealth creation it attracts, by default, much of the general criticism directed at capitalism concerns the erosion of natural resources and the destruction of the environment. Advertising and promotion possibly attract the keenest public criticism of all because they represent the most visible aspect of marketing. At a micro-level, marketing attracts many criticisms for specific cases of deceit or subterfuge, such as inaccurate or misleading food labelling or differential price advertising. There has also been widespread criticism of marketing practices promoting products that can be harmful to health, especially high fat and high salt foods, cigarettes and alcohol. Concern around the marketing of these products is heightened with respect to vulnerable groups, such as the poor.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Product placement involves all these issues, but also goes beyond them because of the difficulty of categorising it as a marketing practice. It appears to have elements of many other marketing techniques, such as branding, promotion, celebrity endorsement, sponsorship, public relations and advertising, but, crucially, it is based on communication, which, typically, does not reveal its source, motive or, indeed, its very message. This makes the evaluation of product placement particularly problematic.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It is not uncommon for brand owners to try and create dramatically resonant placements by liaising closely with studios in the creative development stage of newly mediated entertainment products. The aim is to integrate brands seamlessly into the feature as part of the plot or characterisation, thus enhancing the credibility and dramatic force of the scene. At the same time, product placement also confers added prestige for the placed brand through exposure in the enhanced reality of a movie. Where placements are poorly integrated into a TV show or movie, they tend to be resisted by consumers, because of the detrimental effect awkward placements have on the quality of the viewers&#8217; entertainment experience. The potential benefits of product placements to brands are well-established, with some notable sales increases of the order of 65 per cent attributed to media placements.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Implicit product placement has drawn relatively little attention from advertising theorists or, indeed, supervisory bodies, despite suspicions that the practice is increasing in scale and subtlety. The key marketing strength of this kind of promotional practice is also the main source of criticisms: consumers are not necessarily aware that the brand reference they see within their entertainment has a promotional motive. Even where sophisticated consumers are aware of the practice, there is no opportunity for them to cognitively separate the brand reference from its context within the entertainment. Hence, product placement offers no opportunity for rational dialogue between advertiser and consumers and no real separation between editorial and advertising.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Generally speaking, consumers are at ease with product placement with some relatively minor qualifications. Research grouped concerns into two main aspects: general concerns about the practice, and specific concerns about particular product categories. One of the strongest criticisms of product placement concerns the feeling among some consumers that it entails subliminal promotional effects. It can, it is assumed, affect people below their level of conscious awareness, so that they are not necessarily able to control their acceptance or rejection of the product placement messages. Another major concern with the practice of product placement is that some people perceive it as a deceptive practice, because it may cause people who are unaware of the rhetorical intent of the product placement to engage in purchasing behaviour.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Particular objections have sometimes been raised about specific product placement categories. Children are seen as a particularly susceptible group when it comes to product placement, because they have not yet developed sensitivity to this type of subtle promotional tool. It is widely accepted that they are not aware of the commercial motive behind conventional advertising until around ten years of age, although their recall of brands seen on TV begins almost as soon as conscious awareness occurs. As an example of exploitation of this type, it is common for cartoon series to be given free of charge to TV channels, since they are promotional devices for the hugely profitable action figure toy business. On the other hand, sponsorship of adult TV shows and, in particular, the relationship between sponsor influence and TV show content, are closely scrutinised by regulators.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Concerns have been expressed by consumers about the promoting of particular product categories using product placement, including alcoholic beverages, drugs and other medical products, and tobacco. While promotion of these product categories arouses general concern with regard to conventional advertising, this is exacerbated with product placement, because of the perception that regulatory authorities exercise a relative lack of control over promotions in this context. While there are codes of practice concerning television sponsorship, product placement deals are often struck between the studio and brand owner and can cover script content and scene props. Such deals can evade the scrutiny of bodies responsible for advertising and promotion, because they are claimed to fall within editorial control.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>What Guide Dogs Do</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>A</b></div><div>Guide dogs help blind or visually impaired people get around in the world. In most countries, they are allowed anywhere that the public is allowed, so they can help their handlers be any place they might want to go to. To do this, a guide dog must know how to keep on a direct route, ignoring distractions such as smells, other animals and people, maintain a steady pace, to the left and just ahead of the handler, recognize and avoid obstacles that the handler won't be able to fit through (narrow passages and low overheads) and obey a number of verbal commands.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>Additionally, a guide dog must know to disobey any command that would put the handler in danger. This skill, called selective disobedience, is perhaps the most amazing thing about guide dogs -- that they can balance obedience with their own assessment of the situation. This capacity is extremely important at road crossings, where the handler and dog must work very closely together to navigate the situation safely. When the team reaches the curb, the dog stops, signalling to the handler that they have reached a crossing. Dogs cannot distinguish the between red, green or amber traffic lights, so the handler must make the decision of when it is safe to proceed across the road. The handler listens to the flow of traffic to figure out when the light has changed and then gives the command &#34;forward.&#34; If there is no danger, the dog proceeds across the road in a straight line. If there are cars approaching, the dog waits until the danger is gone and then follows the forward command.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>In a handler-guide dog team, the guide dog doesn't lead the handler and the handler doesn't completely control the guide dog; the two work together to get from place to place. The guide dog doesn't know where the destination is, so it must follow the handler's instructions of how far to go and when to turn. The handler can't see where obstructions lie, so the guide dog must make its own decisions as to how to navigate the team's path. Each half of the team relies on the other to accomplish the tasks at hand. As a guide dog gets more experience with its handler, it may be able to take on even more responsibility. For example, many veteran guide dogs know all of their master's usual destinations. All the handler has to tell them is &#34;go to the office&#34; or &#34;find the coffee shop,&#34; and the guide dog will follow the complete route!</div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>Most guide dog schools use golden retrievers, Labrador retrievers or German shepherds. These three breeds are characterized by intelligence, obedience, stamina and friendliness, and so are well suited for the job. Guide dog schools breed their dogs very carefully, choosing parents with intelligence and special guiding ability. Even with this attention to good breeding, many puppies don't turn out to be suited for the job. Instructors screen puppies for guiding aptitude, and release 20 percent of them from the program. Training is a rigorous process for both the instructors and the dogs, but it's also a lot of fun. To make sure the dogs are up to the challenge, most schools put them through extensive trials before beginning the training. The tests are designed to assess the dogs' self-confidence level, since only extremely confident dogs will be able to deal with the pressure of guiding instruction. If a dog passes the tests, it begins the training program right away.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>Different schools have different programs, but typically, training will last four to five months. To make sure the dogs master all the complex guide skills, the instructors have to introduce them to each idea gradually. Once they have introduced what is expected of the dog, training is essentially a matter of rewarding correct performance and changing incorrect performance. This works with dogs because they are pack animals and have a natural need to please an authority figure. The instructor, and later the handler, is simply stepping into the place of the alpha dog, the leader of the pack. Unlike ordinary obedience training, guide dog training does not use food as a reward for good performance. This is because a guide dog must be able to work around food without being distracted by it. Instead, instructors use praise or other reward systems to encourage correct performance. The standard means of correction is pulling on the dog's leash, so that it pulls a training collar, giving the dog a slight pinch. Using this basic reward/punishment system, instructors work through the necessary skills for guiding.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>Guide dogs are typically trained by highly qualified instructors, who are assisted by a number of apprentice instructors. Procedures vary from school to school, but in general, trainers must spend two to three years as a supervised apprentice before they can move up to a master instructor. Instructors and apprentice instructors are typically college graduates with a good deal of prior experience dealing with both animals and people. Because most guide dog schools are non-profit institutions, instructor pay is relatively low for the education level required; even so, openings don't come up all that often, and attract many hopeful applicants. Often, trainers work their way up to apprentice instructor by working with the school on a lower level, such as raising guide dog puppies. The job is extremely demanding intellectually, emotionally and physically. Instructors work very hard for long hours, and they must constantly deal not only with difficult animals but also with difficult people. It is definitely rewarding work, though. Instructors say they get a great deal of satisfaction from helping a difficult dog master its job, and they're certainly very happy putting together a functioning dog-and-handler team.<br></div>",

They educate, provide space for creativity and offer healthy social interaction. One important aspect in a game is that following directions can be crucial to success. In order to progress in games, one must first learn to follow the guidelines, restrictions and components of them. As the player confronts new challenges, they must use problem-solving to find solutions. This is true for educational games, mind games, and Role Playing Games alike. The player cannot get through with what they already have or know and must find new combinations and incorporate old skills with new skills to overcome obstacles such as the level or quest (Gee, 2003). In relation to this, the player can also learn strategy and anticipation, management of resources (simulation games), mapping, pattern recognition, how to judge the situation and practice reading (with directions, dialogue, etc.) and quantitative calculations (through educational games, managing finances, buying and selling for profit, etc. (Tumbokon, 2014).<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>But at the same time, the best examples are very addictive and gamers are tempted to play for increasing lengths of time. Excessive behaviour in any area of life rightly signals alarm bells for parents. However, for an emerging technology like games, it can be hard to differentiate between excess and enthusiasm. It's difficult for parents to judge what is a healthy time commitment if they are not game-players themselves. One approach is to look at the available statistics. A 2012 consumer study demonstrated that a surprisingly wide range of ages play games: 40% of the UK population in fact, of which 24% play at least weekly. This picture is brought into greater focus by last year&#8217;s government briefing. It states that in England, video games were played for two hours or more a day by 55% of boys and 20% of girls in 2010.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>On the more extreme end of the spectrum, the clinical physiologist Dr Jane Hucksteth (2010) reported that 7% of teens in the UK play more than 30 hours of computer games a week. However the impact on their school work and social life needed further study. &#8220;It is agreed that excessive screen time &#8211; over four hours with no break &#8211; can be a bad thing.&#34; said Dr Hucksteth, &#34;There is a lot of research on this. However, we should also consider time of day, weekends versus school days and the age of the child before we can assess the overall impact on their welfare. &#8221;Gaming is far from a diagnosable addiction but some of the language of addiction can help parents identify when things are getting excessive&#8221;.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>Indications include playing every day, devoting long periods of time, sacrificing other activities, neglecting homework and moodiness. The last two may describe many of our children, but Hucksteth suggests that where four or more of these factors exist there may be cause for concern and a need for parents to step in. &#34;Games should be played as part of a healthy and balanced lifestyle,&#34; agrees Dr Jo Twynum of UKIE, the UK games industry trade body. &#8220;Players should take regular breaks &#8211; a good guide is five minutes rest every 45 &#8211; 60 minutes of game play.&#8221; In light of this, appropriate gaming time is more about its impact on the child&#8217;s wider life than a hard and fast time limit. As children get older, they will naturally integrate gaming among other activities (outside interests, friendship groups and even homework) so the dividing line will become more blurred.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>Distinguishing gaming habits from time spent on other forms of screen time is also important. While TV and video games appear similar on the surface, the interactive nature of the latter results in an experience more like a physical toy. Dr Twynum highlights this misunderstanding. &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure games provide any different parameters to other immersive activities. Would we ask &#8216;How long should children play Lego for&#8217;?&#8221;. Video games offer distinct advantages over television, particularly the recent trend in cross-over titles like &#34;Skylanders&#34; and &#34;Disney Infinity&#34;; these come with plastic action figures which allow children to play away from the screen &#8211; although, of course, parents may object to the costs involved in buying multiple characters on top of the games themselves.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>If parents are concerned that their child is spending excess time on gaming, keeping game technology in shared spaces rather than bedrooms is by far the most effective and informal solution. This does require compromise on both the part of the child (losing their private pursuit) and the parent (having to share the living room) but has the advantage of not only keeping games under surveillance but encouraging families to play together &#8211; something that children are often more enthusiastic about than parents anticipate. Using Parental Controls to restrict access to particular games is a good driver for conversation and agreement over appropriate gaming habits in a family. There are also specific hardware features, for example a timer that pauses the action after a pre-determined amount of daily screen time. A combination of these reference points, regular breaks, along with moving technology back into family spaces, ensures parents and children maintain a healthy relationship to video games and involvement in the family unit.<br></div>",

New developments in the construction of screen glass might mean such technologies are on the way. Scientists have released a study about building light- based sensors into the physical structure of glass used for device screens. The sensors are placed in stackable layers using finer detail than ever before.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>B</b></div><div>The technology means apps can get more accurate readings from far more sensors than just those already placed under screens to detect a touch or swipe. It uses laser to inscribe wave-guides into the glass, which then use light to describe the transmission of information. Two prototype applications of this have already been built. The first is a temperature sensor which reads body temperature from the touch of a finger. The other is a unique authentication system that uses tiny dots to scatter infrared light that can be read by the device's camera. &#34;It's like a permanent and unique barcode on every smartphone that's very difficult to counterfeit and also not easily seen, so doesn't intrude in the operation of the phone,&#34; said Dr Hugh Evans of the Grant Materials Lab.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>C</b></div><div>Wearable computing devices such as smartwatches, tracking wristbands and spectacle- like computers are gadgets that clip to clothes, wrap around wrists and mimic glasses &#8211; and they all need some kind of glass display. With the possibility of more detailed sensors built into an interface substrate like a touchscreen, it potentially makes every glass surface a computer. Of the industries set to receive a boost, observers say wearable computing devices in particular will benefit, as we demand more responsiveness from devices. While major companies have not yet brought advanced wearables into the mainstream, they are now starting to emerge from the realm of science fiction into reality, helped by the new glass.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>D</b></div><div>&#34;I see this advance being even more useful for wearables like glasses and watches,&#34; says Jeremy Rodrigues, founder of Mexican app developers JR Design, which makes mobile apps to help guide travellers in unfamiliar cities. &#34;Putting transparent sensors on glasses and watches will reduce the circuit box needed for these devices, which in turn will make them more attractive and easier to wear.&#34; The basis for laser-inscribed wave- guides opens the field to even more circuits based on light, and thus, more advanced wearable computing devices. These will typically enable the wearer to take and view pictures or video, read text messages and emails, respond to voice commands, browse the web and more.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>E</b></div><div>Wearable computing devices are small, portable and so new that nobody knows how they'll fare with consumers or in the enterprise. Looking back at the fast rise of smartphones and tablets, you might assume that wearables will repeat that performance. But smartphones and tablets are &#34;cool&#34; devices that flipped the workplace upside down because they help employees perform with more efficiency and productivity. These devices -- and the apps and services that come with them -- are easy to set up and use. Further, they can sidestep many of the limitations of more traditional IT-managed applications and services.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>F</b></div><div>It is still unknown whether wearable computing devices will be able to deliver all that. What we do know is that workers wearing smart devices will not need to reach into their pockets as often. Instead, people will be able to gesture, speak or blink to retrieve the information they need or to accomplish tasks. The question is: Are workers really encumbered by having to reach for their devices? There are certainly a few ways the enterprise could benefit from employees' use of wearable computing devices. The hands-free and location-independent operations of wearables could have a number of potential uses.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>G</b></div><div>For example, Eurotech's Zypad delivers a wrist-mounted mini-computer to those needing high-tech mobility and connectivity in the field, such as emergency personnel, search-and-rescue teams, warehouse workers or anyone on the move. Wearables also make it possible to track individuals, such as nurses performing rounds or emergency workers in the field. For environmental disaster work in which employees must wear protective suiting, a wearable device could be an invaluable asset by offering hands- free access to vital data. Finally, smart glasses could be capable of displaying schematics to a technician repairing a specialized piece of machinery, which means no hands and no fuss. All the information workers needed would be before their eyes.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>H</b></div><div>But possibilities do not always translate into uptake, and while there are some exciting potential uses for wearable computing devices in the modern enterprise or company, their spread will depend on device developers and the needs of employees to connect to company data storage and more conventional computing platforms. Developers and organizations will need to build business programs and web services that integrate with these devices and can reliably push data to them and use data received from them.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Growing Oysters</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Oysters have been farmed since Roman times, and in many areas approaches are much the same as they were back then, because they still work. However, there has also been quite a leap in farming methods, which has allowed oysters to be farmed much more efficiently or in areas where it would not have been possible before.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Baby oyster seeds are obtained by farms from hatcheries each spring. The seed is only about 1 millimeter in length and is packed in a very fine mesh enclosure. The seeds look like small pepper flakes when they arrive, and they are placed in floating upwellers, where the tiny oyster babies are in a protected environment. Here they can feed and grow on nutrient rich water. Pumps push water up and over the oysters in small silos, so they constantly receive a fresh supply of phytoplankton. The baby oysters remove excess nitrogen and carbon based nutrients from the water, thereby improving water quality and clarity in a nitrogen and carbon negative process. Oysters, like any animal, grow at diverse rates, so the fast growers must be separated from the slow growers. Once the oyster seeds are large enough, they are moved out of the upwellers and placed in mesh bags contained in floating cages, so they can feed in the water column and avoid being smothered by sedimentation.<br></div><div><br></div><div>From time to time, oysters must be placed in an oyster tumbler, which grades them according to size, washes them, and chips off the leading edge of the shell to give the oyster the characteristic cup appearance over time. Simultaneously, the oysters are divided into roughly double the number of cages, thereby increasing the amount of water flow and decreasing the competition for sustenance within the cage. These processes are repeated every 4 weeks throughout the summer and fall. Because of the colder temperatures and lower salinity of winter water, the oysters slow down their feeding and growth and eventually they enter a state of dormancy. During winter, the tumbling and dividing process is stopped and the cages are simply monitored to ensure they remain in good condition.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Once the water temperatures and salinity begin to increase, the oysters wake up and begin feeding and the tumbling and dividing process begins again. Once the oysters reach approximately 2 inches in size, they are placed in cages in more open water, where the wave action will toughen them up and strengthen their abductor muscles. This prepares the oysters for shipment.<br></div><div><br></div><div>After approximately 18 months, the oysters are tough enough and are ready for harvest. The oysters that are ready are washed down, bagged up and placed in boxes if they are being shipped direct. They are then taken away for shipment.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The suitability of growing areas for oysters can be evaluated by the amount and type of pollutants in the various growing areas. Oyster banks should not be exposed to strong currents or wave action under normal tidal conditions or during times of flood. Areas that are prone to shifting sand can also be problematic. These adverse conditions place additional stress on the oyster growing furniture, damage oysters, and make working in these areas difficult. Some balance must be struck between currents and tidal flows to ensure that they supply the oysters with suitable water that is a nutrient-rich food source. Open water also leaves the oysters vulnerable to small fish predation, which can have a serious effect on production yields. The substrate should be firm enough to walk over, and to work on, although this is not always the case. Offshore areas may be problematic if they are not close to a suitable land-based facility and long distances must be travelled each time stock is to be placed or maintenance carried out. Access to markets also needs to be considered, particularly when moving oysters to be processed. Estuary systems are particularly good at producing the populations of phytoplankton that oysters predominantly feed on. As oysters are filter feeders, the selection of maturing grounds is very important to avoid possible contamination. Commercial oyster culture all over the world is managed under stringent eco-guidelines designed to ensure that oysters are only grown in areas with appropriate water quality.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Oyster farmers have to be particularly aware of the signs of QX oyster disease, which is caused by the microscopic parasite Marteilia sydneyi. The spore-like parasites invade an oyster&#8217;s digestive system and multiply in the digestive gland or &#8216;liver&#8217;. These spores are so numerous that the oyster is unable to absorb food and can starve to death within 40 days of infection. Oyster fatality in an infected bank can be as high as 95 per cent. Although QX is usually fatal to oysters, there is absolutely no evidence that it is harmful to consumers. A sign of QX infection is a mass mortality of oysters, though a thorough and correct diagnosis can only be obtained by microscopic examination of the digestive gland for the detection of QX spores. Samples of oysters suspected of QX can be sent away for examination. Once infected, oysters cannot be cured of the disease, but it is still possible to farm oysters in QX-susceptible areas within certain operating constraints. The risk of infection is year round but highest in the summer months.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u><br></div><div><u><br></u></div><div>Upweller&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A small tank used for growing young oysters.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Substrate&#160; &#160; &#160;Underlying ground.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Hypnosis</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>Hypnosis is the induction of a deeply relaxed state, with increased suggestibility and suspension of critical faculties. Once in this state, sometimes called a hypnotic trance, patients are given therapeutic suggestions to encourage changes in behavior or relief of symptoms. For example, in a treatment to stop eating chocolate, a hypnosis practitioner might suggest that the patient will no longer find eating chocolate pleasurable or necessary. Hypnosis for a patient with arthritis might include a suggestion that the pain can be turned down like the volume of a radio. Some practitioners use hypnosis as an aid to psychotherapy. The rationale is that in the hypnotised state, the conscious mind presents fewer barriers to effective psychotherapeutic exploration, leading to an increased likelihood of psychological insight. The primary applications of hypnosis are for anxiety, disorders with a strong psychological component, such as asthma, and conditions that can be modulated by levels of sensory arousal. They are also commonly used in programs for stress management.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>During hypnosis, the critical and analytical faculty of the conscious mind freezes, and a direct rapport is established with the subconscious mind. The conscious mind is that part of the mind that collects information from the environment through the perception of the five senses. It then analyses, organises and interprets this information, and uses it for future reference. It is responsible for the reasoning, logic and intelligence of the mind. The powers of the conscious mind are limited by past conditioning, past experiences and the logic of the science. People usually consider the conscious mind to be the more dominant, but beneath that is the most powerful part called the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind is responsible for all the autonomic processes in our body like blood pumping, maintaining the blood pressure, heart beat rate, respiration, digestion and all other involuntary functions in the body. It has infinite data storage and data processing capacity. In order to untangle how one level of consciousness influences the other, researchers and hypnotists must try and understand the people&#8217;s subconscious.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>Hypnosis works by reaching into this subconscious mind and updating it with new and more helpful information, like reprogramming a computer. It can be used to change associations, so that cigarettes, for instance, are no longer seen as necessary and are more realistically regarded as toxic killers. It can also be used to mentally rehearse better ways of going about things, such as being able to deal with awkward situations without having to light a cigarette. Since the unconscious mind controls our autonomic bodily processes, physical change can also be achieved through hypnosis. Pain control is a very good example. The mind alters our awareness of pain all the time. People experience this themselves if they discover a cut or a bruise and wonder how it got there. Physical events are still occurring, but the unconscious has relegated them to the bits of sensory information you&#8217;re not aware of every single second. Hypnosis can therefore be used to amplify that same response and apply it to a specific situation, such as the control of headaches. Hypnosis works, then by shaping the&#160;perception of reality through dealing directly with the subconscious mind, which is the seat of most issues, and most solutions, too.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>In hypnosis treatment, patients typically see practitioners by themselves for a course of hourly or halfhourly treatments. Some general practitioners and other medical specialists use hypnosis as part of their regular clinical work and follow a longer initial consultation with standard 10 to 15-minute appointments. Patients can be given a post-hypnotic suggestion that enables them to induce selfhypnosis after the treatment course is completed. Some practitioners undertake group hypnosis, treating up to a dozen patients at a time, for example, teaching self-hypnosis to prenatal groups as preparation for labour.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>Hypnosis has had its critics. Hypnosis can sometimes exacerbate psychological problems, for example, by retraumatising those with post-traumatic disorders or by inducing false memories in psychologically susceptible individuals. Some research has raised concerns that the dissociation necessary to participate in hypnosis can lead to the manifestation of the symptoms of psychosis. Only appropriately trained and experienced practitioners should undertake hypnosis. Its use should be avoided in patients with borderline personality disorder, dissociative disorders, or with patients who have traumatic histories. Competent hypnotherapists are skilled in recognising and referring patients with these conditions.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>The practice of hypnosis is poorly regulated, and standards of practice and training are variable. Although several professional groups exist, these groups do not provide certification for practitioners in hypnotherapy, making the selection of a hypnotherapist sometimes problematic. Hypnotherapists with a conventional health care background, such as psychologists, physicians, dentists, and nurses, are regulated by their professional regulatory bodies. Psychotherapists who use hypnotherapy as an additional treatment modality require appropriate training. Individuals who have received a master&#8217;s degree in counseling or social work or a doctorate in clinical or counseling psychology will be likely to have received appropriate training and supervision.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>Law enforcement agencies have always been interested in the potential applications of hypnotism. The question of the utility of hypnosis in the interrogation of persons unwilling to divulge information involves three issues: first, can hypnosis be induced under conditions of interrogation? If so, can the subject be compelled to reveal information? Secondly, if information can be so obtained, will it be trustworthy? And thirdly, is it ethical to perform this kind of interrogation? If the answers to all these questions are, &#8216;yes&#8217;, the next problem is then to induce a trance either against the subject&#8217;s wishes or without his being aware of it.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u><br></div><div><u><br></u></div><div>Psychosis<br></div><div>A severe mental disorder in which thought and emotions are so impaired that contact is lost with external reality.<br></div>",

Wellplanned vegetarian diets have many health benefits and can provide all the essential vitamins and minerals necessary for a long and healthy life.<br></div><div><br></div><div>People have many reasons for becoming vegetarians. Some want to eat more healthy foods. Others have religious or economic reasons or are concerned about animal welfare. &#8220;Vegetarian diets are also more sustainable and environmentally sound than diets that rely heavily on meat, poultry and fish,&#8221; says nutritionist Dr. Karen Morgan, who monitors trends in cancer risk factors. &#8220;Livestock production accounts for nearly 80 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture worldwide and it also places a much heavier burden on water, land and fossil fuel resources than grains and other crops.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Vegetarian meals focus on fruits and vegetables, dried beans, whole grains, seeds and nuts. Most people think of vegetarian diets as simply eating plant foods and not eating meat, poultry and fish. &#8220;However,&#8221; as Morgan explains, &#8220;there are in fact many different types of vegetarian diets and some are more restrictive than others.&#8221; Strict vegetarians, or vegans, eat plant foods and reject all animal products, including meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy and honey. Those who also eat dairy products are called lacto vegetarians. Vegetarians who eat both dairy and eggs are called lactoovo vegetarians. Some vegetarians eat fish but not meat or poultry and they&#8217;re called pescatarians. &#8220;Then there are the so-called flexitarians, or semi-vegetarians. These are people who eat a mostly vegetarian diet, but they occasionally eat meat,&#8221; says Josie Elkei, a nutritionist and registered dietitian at NIH. &#8220;They might say, &#8216;I&#8217;m a vegetarian, but I need to eat my burgers every Sunday.&#8217; People tend to follow their own rules, which is one reason why it&#8217;s hard to study vegetarians. There&#8217;s so much variance.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Vegetarians exhibit a wide diversity of dietary practices, often described by what is omitted from their diet. When a vegetarian diet is appropriately planned and includes fortified foods, it can be nutritionally satisfactory for adults and children and can promote health and lower the risk of major chronic diseases. The nutrients of concern in the diet of vegetarians include vitamin B12, vitamin D, some fatty acids, calcium, iron, and zinc. Elkei explains what can be done. &#8220;Although a vegetarian diet can meet current recommendations for all of these nutrients, a poorly planned vegetarian diet can cause deficiencies and so the use of fortified foods and pills provides a useful shield.&#8221; However, a vegetarian diet usually provides a low intake of saturated fat and cholesterol and a high intake of dietary fiber and many health-promoting phytochemicals. This is achieved by an increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole-grains, legumes, nuts, and various soy products. General practitioner Mark Thomas explains the benefits of this. &#8220;As a result of this kind of diet, vegetarians typically have lower body mass index, serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and blood pressure, reduced rates of death from ischemic heart disease, and&#160;decreased incidence of hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers than do nonvegetarians.&#8221; In some cases, however, it is unclear if the specific health benefits come from plantbased eating or from the healthy lifestyle of most vegetarians. Personal trainer Alicia Field notes that &#8220;vegetarians are generally more physically active and have healthier habits than nonvegetarians. They also typically have a higher socioeconomic status.&#8221; Researcher Stan Wade has been determined to find out the truth of whether vegetarianism of lifestyle is the greater indicator of health and, over the last few years, he has conducted large and carefully controlled studies that have explored this. Wade presents his results. &#8220;It&#8217;s clear that the elements of lifestyle and vegetarianism complement each other and both included factors that aid long life. Meat eaters, however, who take plenty of exercise and have healthy habits are also likely to live long and healthy lives.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>One issue that many vegetarians face is when they eat out. Most restaurant menus are geared towards meat eaters, and their vegetarian offerings are often limited to meat dishes with the absence of meat. Unfortunately, taking meat away from a dish doesn&#8217;t mean that vegetarians are getting a healthy, well-balanced vegetarian meal. Because of this, if vegetarians eat out frequently, it can be difficult for them to get the proper nutrition their bodies need. If an individual is committed to a vegetarian lifestyle, however, having issues eating out is not a significant drawback.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Well-planned vegan and vegetarian diets are appropriate for all stages of a person&#8217;s life. However, special care needs to be taken with young children. Infants consuming their mothers&#8217; milk or infant formula usually have their nutritional needs met. When introducing complementary foods for children, it is important to include protein-rich foods, such as mashed tofu or cottage cheese. Later, add cheese, cow&#8217;s milk, full-fat soy milk and legumes. Iron is another important nutrient needed because body iron stores are usually depleted by six months of age. Sources of iron for vegetarian diets include cereals for babies fortified with iron, beans and dark green vegetables. Celia Tremlett, a child nutritionist, suggests an approach. &#8220;One way to ensure that vegetarian children meet their energy needs is to give them frequent meals and snacks and it is particularly important that vegetarian children have energy and nutrient-dense foods regularly.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>When reviewing the facts, it is hard to understand why more people don&#8217;t embrace vegetarianism. Although the convenience of meat options and a lack of knowledge stop many people from trying it, the chief factor that stops people seems just to be the meat-eating habit. Whatever people choose to eat, however, it&#8217;s clear that moderation and balance are key to being happy and healthy.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Taipan</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b><br></div><div>Taipans have the unenviable reputation of being Australia&#8217;s most deadly snakes. There are three types of taipan: the inland taipan, the coastal taipan and the central ranges taipan. The longest venomous snake in Australia, the coastal taipan reaches an average length of 2.5 metres, with a maximum length of 3.35 metres. The head of a coastal taipan is large, rectangular-shaped and distinct from its narrow neck. The eye is a reddish colour. Adult coastal taipans have a uniformly light or dark-brown colouration above with a creamy-yellow belly that usually has reddish or pink spots towards the front. The inland taipan is olive-coloured in the summer and dark brown in winter, with dark, smooth scales arranged in diagonal rows. The colour change is an adaptation that allows it to absorb more heat in winter and less heat in summer. The central ranges taipan is the third type of taipan, but it was only discovered in 2007. Dr Mark Hutchinson, reptile and amphibian curator at the South Australian Museum, caught an immature female taipan while it was crossing a dirt track. He said the reptile was about one metre long, but, because it was one of the most venomous snakes in the world, he did not inspect the creature on site. It was not until two weeks later that the snake was studied and the new species was confirmed. It is similar in size and colouring to the western brown snake, with which it is often confused. The different taipans have not been assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature; however, they are considered as &#8216;Near Threatened&#8217; or &#8216;Rare&#8217; in Queensland. They are protected by law and a special permit is required to capture them, as well as a separate special license to own them.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>Although all three types of taipan are extremely venomous, they do not kill many people. For example, in spite of the toxicity of its venom, there has been no single fatality recorded from the bite of an inland taipan. On average, only one bite is recorded per year and sometimes none at all. This is because inland taipans live far away from people and are usually only active in the early morning. Also, inland taipans are shy snakes and when encountered by humans, they flee and hide rather than fight. The coastal taipan is more of a naturally hostile snake, although if disturbed, it will generally retreat. Humans are rarely bitten but, if a taipan is cornered or attacked, it will viciously defend itself, striking repeatedly with speed and accuracy. Coastal taipans are found around human habitations, so they are commonly encountered by people in sheds, farm buildings and waste heaps.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>The taipan is particularly dangerous to humans, because it is a mammal specialist, feeding almost exclusively on mammals, which is quite uncommon. As a result of this specialism, the taipan&#8217;s venom has evolved to be extremely lethal for all mammals, including humans. The snake&#8217;s venom is so potent because it combines two types of toxic components that start affecting the human body very soon&#160;after entering the person&#8217;s system. The poison has a conglomerate of neurotoxins and haemotoxins, which attack the body on multiple levels. Neurotoxins affect a person&#8217;s ability to control his or her body. Within an hour of being bitten, a person will start experiencing symptoms such as slurred speech, seizures, difficulty breathing or an inability to control his or her limbs. Haemotoxins affect the blood&#8217;s ability to clot, leading to internal bleeding and organ damage.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>Like other snakes, the taipan is an ambush predator that silently stalks its prey and then strikes when the time is right. Unlike other venomous snakes, though, the taipan doesn&#8217;t just deliver a single bite and then wait for the animal to die from the venom. Rather, the inland taipan delivers up to eight bites in a single strike, and then holds its prey. Now this may seem dangerous, since prey usually fight back, but not for the inland taipan. The venom is so potent that the prey has no chance to put up a fight and the inland taipan swallows it whole without a fuss. Although the different taipans are all fearsome predators, they do have predators of their own. Newly-hatched and immature taipans have a number of natural enemies, including various birds of prey and goannas. Adult taipans are eaten by the king brown snake, which is immune to its venom, and the perentie, the fourth largest living lizard which can grow over 8 feet long. Humans still routinely kill coastal taipans on sight, as they are the ones who can live near human habitations.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>Taipans are among the oviparous snakes, which means they lays egg, usually in burrows abandoned by mammals or in deep, wide cracks in the soil. They can lay as many as 20 eggs or as few as 11, the average being 16. They can produce two clutches of eggs in a year, especially if there is a lot of food. The eggs hatch after 9 to 11 weeks and the newly hatched snakes are around 18 inches long. They do not receive any parental care, but already possess a deadly dose of venom with which to hunt and defend themselves. Taipans hatched in captivity grow incredibly fast, and can reach over a metre in their first year. Growth rates for taipans not in captivity are not known; however, the lack of small specimens in museum collections may suggest that the species grows rapidly under natural conditions as well.<br></div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u><br></div><div><u><br></u></div><div>Goanna&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; A large Australian monitor lizard.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Threats to the Polar Bear</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Polar bears are classified as marine mammals because they spend most of their lives on the sea ice of the Arctic Ocean. They have a thick layer of body fat and a water-repellent coat that protects them from the cold air and water. Considered talented swimmers, they can sustain a pace of six miles per hour by paddling with their front paws and holding their hind legs flat to act like a rudder.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Iconic symbols of the Arctic, polar bears are distributed across the five Arctic coastal countries of Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Russia, and the United States. The worldwide population is currently estimated to be between 22,000 and 25,000 bears. Scientists have divided the total polar bear population into 19 units or subpopulations. Of those, the latest data from the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group show that three subpopulations are in decline and that there is a high estimated risk of future decline due to climate change.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Polar bears live throughout the ice-covered waters of the circumpolar Arctic, particularly in near shore annual ice over the continental shelf, where productivity is highest. The most significant threat facing the long-term survival of polar bears is the loss of this habitat due to climate change. Projected reductions in the extent and thickness of sea ice in the polar bear&#8217;s range will have direct and indirect effects on polar bears, with habitat loss and degradation and reduced prey availability respectively. The latter is reduced, because polar bears rely on sea ice to hunt and store energy for the summer and autumn, when food can be scarce. The bears need sea ice for hunting, as they cannot outswim seals, their preferred prey. They get around this by waiting near holes in the ice and employing ambush to kill the seals as they come up for air. Polar bears spend over 50 per cent of their time hunting for food, yet they might catch only one or two out of ten seals they hunt, depending on the time of year and other variables. Their diet mainly consists of ringed and bearded seals, because they need large quantities of fat to stay alive.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In the short term, climatic warming may improve bear and seal habitats in higher latitudes over continental shelves if currently thick multiyear ice is replaced by annual ice with more leads, making it more suitable for seals. However, a cascade of impacts from reduced sea ice will take place. Firstly, reduced fat stores will lead to lowered reproductive rates, because females will have less fat to invest in cubs during the winter fast. Secondly, non-pregnant bears may have to fast on land or offshore on the remaining multiyear ice through progressively longer periods of open water while they await freeze-up and a return to hunting seals. Thirdly, as sea ice thins and becomes more fractured and easily changed, it is likely to move more in response to currents, so that polar bears will need to walk or swim more and thus use greater amounts of calories to maintain contact with the remaining preferred habitats. Fourthly, as the bears spend longer periods without food, their health declines. For example, for every week earlier the ice breaks up in Hudson Bay, bears come ashore roughly 10 kilograms lighter and in poorer condition. Unhealthy bears can lead to even fewer cubs being born into these threatening circumstances.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another threat to polar bears is the oil and gas business, which is increasingly moving into the Arctic as more accessible reserves in the south dry up. This is a danger, as contact with oil spills can reduce the insulation of the bears&#8217; fur. In addition, polar bears can also ingest oil through grooming and through eating contaminated prey. The ingested oil can cause liver and kidney damage, and has longterm toxicity; bears can be poisoned by even a limited amount of oil on their fur. Offshore operations pose the greatest risk, since spills will be discharged directly into the sea or on the sea ice. Polar bear populations are expected to come under increased pressure if oil developments in the Arctic go ahead according to industry plans. Other pollution also threatens polar bears. Because of their role as the apex predator, polar bears are exposed to high levels of pollutants through their food. The popular image of polar bears living in a pure, frozen wilderness is misleading, as the Arctic food chain contains high levels of some toxic chemicals. Bears with high levels of some persistent organic pollutants have low levels of vitamin A, thyroid hormones, and some antibodies. These are important for a wide range of biological functions, such as growth, reproduction, and the ability to fight off diseases. In some areas, the mother bears&#8217; milk contains particularly high concentrations of these chemicals and so the milk can actually poison the cubs, leading to even lower survival rates.<br></div><div><br></div><div>It is the loss of habitat, however, that really threatens polar bears. The effects of climate change are likely to show large geographic, temporal and even individual differences and be highly variable, making it difficult to develop adequate monitoring and research programs. All bears show behavioural plasticity, but given the rapid pace of ecological change in the Arctic, the long generation time, and the highly specialised nature of polar bears, it is unlikely that polar bears will survive as a species if the sea ice disappears completely, as has been predicted by some scientists.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Nuclear Power</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>One of the most significant advantages of nuclear power is that compared to coal, gas, and other electricity-generating plants, nuclear is the lowest by far in greenhouse gas release. Carbon dioxide and similar gases, known for depleting the Earth&#8217;s atmosphere, have notoriously been an issue in the climate change debate. Due to this fact, nuclear energy has once again been looked at for power production and nuclear energy produces 62 percent of all emission-free electricity in the United States. In nuclear reactors that utilise large cooling towers, it&#8217;s a common misconception that pollution is massively dumped into the air. The large clouds people see leaving the smoke stacks are nothing more than steam.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another appealing reason for using nuclear energy is its excellent fuel to power ratio. It has the capacity to meet all needs with just one reactor, let alone multiple, and a relatively small amount of uranium can be used to fuel a 1000-megawatt electric plant providing enough electricity to power a city of about half a million people. Renewable sources, such as solar and wind, provide only enough power to meet residential needs. They don&#8217;t yet have the capacity of nuclear to handle large-scale power needs, especially in the manufacturing world.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Although the initial costs to build nuclear plants are high, nuclear power produces very inexpensive electricity once up and running. Electricity generated by nuclear reactors is cheaper than gas, coal, or any other fossil fuel plants. Also, uranium is a fairly cheap fuel source, and just a little of it is needed to produce massive power. When you combine all that with a lifecycle of 40 to 60 years, the low operating costs far outweigh the high upfront costs to build.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Nuclear power also improves the state of the economy and local communities are, more often than not, pro-nuclear due to the amount of jobs a new plant brings. On average, a new nuclear plant creates 400 to 700 permanent jobs, not to mention thousands of others during its construction. This is comparable to just 90 jobs for a coal plant, and 50 jobs for a natural gas plant. The main reason local communities are so happy over nuclear plants is that each facility generates close to $500 million annually in sales of goods and services. More workers at plants means more people who need lunches and more people with money to spend.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Quite possibly the most important benefit of nuclear energy is that it doesn&#8217;t rely on fossil fuels and this means it&#8217;s not affected by the unpredictability of oil and gas costs. It also means that we won&#8217;t be depleting the Earth&#8217;s supply of resources nearly as quickly, as nuclear power requires much less fuel to produce a higher amount of energy. With the current supply of uranium, it is estimated that the world has at least another 80 years before supply becomes an issue, but there are also other forms of uranium that can be used if needed, extending that timeline even further. This is plenty of time to find alternative sources (such as nuclear fusion, the holy grail of energy), if need be. Nuclear energy,&#160;however, is not powered by a renewable fuel source. Uranium is in limited (although currently abundant) supply, whereas typical renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are in infinite supply. Uranium has to be mined, synthesised, then activated to produce energy, and it&#8217;s expensive to go through this process.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Nuclear energy has a number of positive aspects, making it appealing to more and more countries worldwide; however, like all energy sources, it has its downsides. Many people are scared of nuclear power due to the few, although very significant, accidents that have taken place over the years. And while nuclear energy operates with little pollution to the environment, it certainly isn&#8217;t without its environmental impacts.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Possibly the biggest concern among nuclear energy advocates is the environmental impact of uranium as a fuel source. A typical nuclear power plant generates about 20 metric tons of used nuclear fuel per year. The problem is that this spent fuel is highly radioactive and it&#8217;s not a fuel source you can take to a landfill and leave without worry. It has to be carefully handled and stored, which costs a lot of money, and it requires a significant amount of specially designed storage space. Spent nuclear fuel takes hundreds of years to decompose before it reaches adequate levels of safety. For this reason alone, it becomes an issue that other energy sources simply don&#8217;t have to deal with.<br></div><div><br></div><div>As well as spent fuel, there is also a significant amount of low-level nuclear waste to dispose of. Lowlevel waste can include radioactively contaminated protective clothing, tools, filters, rags, medical tubes, and many other items. Storage sites for this are always underground in a reinforced concrete vault and covered with large amounts of topsoil, and immediately encircling the facility is a layer of impermeable backfill. The waste is stored in canisters until the radioactivity has decayed away and can be disposed of as ordinary trash.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Expense can also be a major deterrent for countries looking to build new nuclear plants. The construction of a new plant can take anywhere from 5 to 10 years to build, costing billions of dollars. Much of that and more is recouped throughout the lifetime of the plant, but it is clear how some nations might be reluctant to pursue nuclear energy. Decommissioning expenses are also significant.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Although nuclear energy always provokes emotional debate, there is no denying that it remains as a viable option to solving Earth&#8217;s increasing energy needs over the next hundred years.<br></div>",

There are many types of meditation, but most have four elements in common: a quiet location with as few distractions as possible; a specific, comfortable posture (sitting, lying down, walking, or in other positions); a focus of attention (a specially chosen word or set of words, an object, or the sensations of the breath); and an open attitude (letting distractions come and go naturally without judging them).</span> &#10;<br></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Although there is little recorded history on meditation, its roots go back to ancient times. Teacher and practitioner Mary Rogers explains: &#8220;Researchers speculate that primitive hunter-gatherer societies may have discovered meditation and its altered states of consciousness while gazing at the flames of their fires. Then, over thousands of years, meditation evolved into a structured practice.&#8221; It seems meditation was first popular in the East with Indian scriptures known as &#8216;tantras&#8217; mentioning meditation techniques five thousand years ago. Meditation took thousands of years to spread to Western societies and it was not until the twentieth century when it finally started to gain popularity in the West. Historian David Luttley describes how this happened: &#8220;Meditation spread to the West initially due to an increase in the popularity of Buddhism. Meditation being a central part of this religion meant that as Buddhism spread, other countries and cultures soon adopted many different forms of meditation.&#8221;</span> &#10;<br></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Supporters of meditation claim that it can be a part of people&#8217;s lives in different ways and is often practiced to acquire balance in people&#8217;s physical, emotional, and mental states. Oliver Sachs, an Australian businessman, is an ardent fan. &#8220;I find that the deep rest that meditation gives me enables me to make better choices. I can work better all through the day and I sleep better at night.&#8221; Meditation has also been used to help people quit smoking and conquer drug and alcohol addictions. Doctor Kristina Smith has researched meditation and found that there are definite biological and psychological benefits. &#8220;Proficient meditative practices help to integrate the brain functions and regulate various physiological mechanisms resulting in a state of mental and physical well-being.&#8221;</span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">One of the most important claimed benefits of meditation is how it releases stress from people&#8217;s bodies. Psychologist Angela Matthews is an expert in this field and has theorised that there is a connection to mankind&#8217;s development over time due to evolution. &#8220;When people&#8217;s bodies are exposed to a sudden threat, they respond with the characteristic fight or flight reaction that is known as an adrenaline rush. If people are in extreme danger, these reactions are of great assistance and gain to them. The same response is now triggered in our daily lives when people are in a traffic hold-up or someone irritates us at work. If people do not confront things (and some things are beyond their control), they end up being in a permanent state of stress.&#8221;</span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Related to stress, a recent study found that meditation helped college students decrease psychological distress and increase coping ability. These kinds of students are also at high risk for developing hypertension, and the meditation was also associated with decreases in blood pressure. The study&#8217;s researchers randomly assigned students to a meditation group or a control group. They also created a high-risk subgroup, based on blood pressure readings, family history, and weight. The meditation group received a seven-step course in meditation techniques, with invitations to attend refresher meetings, and kept track of how often they practised meditation. At the beginning of the study and after three months, researchers tested all participants for blood pressure and psychological measures. The study&#8217;s director, Anton Hayden, was happy with the results, but also gave another suggestion. &#8220;These findings suggest that young adults at risk of developing hypertension may be able to reduce that risk by practicing meditation. However, we recommend that future studies of meditation in college students evaluate long-term effects on blood pressure and psychological distress, so that our short-term results can be endorsed.&#8221;</span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Finally, it seems that meditation can have various beneficial effects on the brain. Long-term meditators apparently have better-preserved brains than non-meditators as they age, as well as an increase in the thickness of the hippocampus, which governs learning and memory. Meditators also have more development in the areas of the brain that play roles in emotion regulation and self-referential processing. Younger developing brains can also be beneficially affected and there has been increasing interest from educators and researchers in bringing meditation to school kids, who are dealing with the usual stressors inside school, and often additional stress and trauma outside school. San Francisco high school principal, Nicola Roberts, explains how her school has been transformed. &#8220;Although I was sceptical at first, we started a twice daily meditation program and saw suspensions decrease, GPA&#8217;s increase and absenteeism decrease.&#8221;</span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Although meditation has many detractors, those who practise it are vociferous in their support. More and more people are starting to take up meditation at home and work and increasing numbers of doctors are starting to prescribe it. Additional studies are also being conducted about the effects of meditation and, as more expertise is gathered, meditation will become a more accurately and frequently approved treatment.</span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><u>Glossary</u></span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Hypertension - abnormally high blood pressure</span></span></span></div><div><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br></span></span></span></div>",

          "content": "<b>The History of Salt</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>Since its discovery, several thousand years ago, salt has profoundly affected human life, not only with respect to the feeding habits or the ancient food preserving home industry, but also in human, economic, mythological and religious spheres. As a precious and portable good, salt has long been a cornerstone of economies throughout history. Salt was a greatly appreciated exchange commodity, so much that the so-called &#8216;salt routes&#8217; were born, through which merchants transported and sold it in countries where it was not produced. The production and the transport of salt gave rise to new cities and to the construction of roads and it has been conjectured that the first civilisations began along the edges of the desert because of the natural surface deposits of salt found there. Finally, all of the working population today have an indirect link to salt, as Roman legionnaires were paid in salt. This was known as &#8216;salarium,&#8217; the Latin origin of the word &#8216;salary.&#8217;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>Salt was in general use long before history as we know it began to be recorded. About four thousand seven hundred years ago, there was published in China the Peng-Tzao-Kan-Mu, probably the earliest known treatise on pharmacology. A major portion of this writing was devoted to the first ever discussion of more than forty kinds of salt, including descriptions of two methods of extracting salt and putting it in usable form, both of which are amazingly similar to processes used today.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>Most people probably think of salt as simply a white granular food seasoning. In fact, only six per cent of all salt manufactured goes into food. Society uses salt in more than fourteen thousand different ways and it is crucial for many industries. Its compounds make it one of the most important materials in the chemical industry, since more than fifty per cent of chemical products depend on it at a stage of their manufacture. Salt therefore plays a role in the manufacture of a variety of commodities such as plastic, paper, glass, polyester, rubber and fertilisers, household bleach, soaps and detergents.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>A popular custom still in use in a number of European countries requires that a handful of salt be thrown in the coffin of a dead person before the burial. The salt was considered a symbol of incorruptibility and immortality and would thus keep away the devil. For the same reason in ancient Scotland, salt was added in the brewing of beer, which would otherwise have been ruined by witches and evil spirits. In point of fact, the added salt had the effect of preventing excessive fermentation in the brew and therefore stopped potential corruption. In some countries, if salt is dropped onto the floor, some should be picked up and thrown back over the left shoulder into the eye of the devil, who would be waiting behind.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>Salt has also had military significance. For instance, it is recorded that thousands of Napoleon&#8217;s troops died during his retreat from Moscow because their wounds would not heal as a result of a lack of salt. In December, 1864, Union forces in the US Civil War made a forced march and fought a 36-hour battle to capture Saltville, Virginia, the site of an important salt processing plant, essential to sustaining the South&#8217;s beleaguered armies. Salt was considered so crucial in the US Civil War that Confederate President Jefferson Davis offered to waive military service to anyone willing to tend coastal salt kettles to supply the South&#8217;s war effort.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>Throughout history, the fundamental importance of salt has subjected it to governmental monopoly and special taxes. The British monarchy supported itself with high salt taxes, leading to a bustling black market for the white crystal. In 1785, it was written that every year in England, 10,000 people were arrested for salt smuggling. French kings too developed a salt monopoly by selling exclusive rights to produce it to a favoured few that exploited the right to the point where the scarcity of salt was a contributing cause of the French Revolution. In more modern times, Mahatma Gandhi defied British salt laws as a means of mobilising popular support for self-rule in India. In recent years, the promotion of free trade through the World Trade Organization has led to abolition of many national monopolies, allowing the price of salt to be set by only market forces.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>Unsurprisingly, salt manufacture has often been found next to the sea. The town of Lymington on the south coast of the UK was a major salt-making hub and used a common method to create the product. Seawater was captured at high tide in a reservoir; this in turn was fed into a shallow pond by opening a sluice gate. Here, the seawater was left to partially evaporate. When the brine was of sufficient strength, it was pumped by windmill to a holding tank. From there, pipes fed it down to the metal pans in the boiling house, under which coal fires were lit and the brine was boiled until the moisture was evaporated, leaving the final product. The Lymington sea salt manufacture was seasonal and dependent on good weather, so an average season was sixteen weeks. Each pan would produce about three tons a week and the town supplied most of southern England with salt. Lymington salt was also exported in large quantities to the Newfoundland fisheries, as well as many other countries around the world.</div>",

          "content": "<b>Corporal Punishment</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Corporal punishment is a contentious and much debated issue within society. Corporal punishment is defined as the use of physical force towards a child for the purpose of control and/or correction, and as a disciplinary penalty inflicted on the body with the intention of causing some degree of pain or discomfort, however mild. Research has shown that corporal punishment is effective in achieving immediate child compliance. However, others have argued that the benefits associated with immediate child amenability can be offset by findings that indicate corporal punishment fails to teach a child self-control and inductive reasoning. Instead, corporal punishment teaches a child to avoid engaging in behaviour that is punishable by way of force while in an adult&#8217;s presence, in contrast to teaching a child not to engage in the undesirable behaviour at all.</div><div><br></div><div>As part of their natural development, children sometimes challenge or test parental and adult expectations and authority and sometimes, children simply choose to misbehave in order to gain something, such as attention, an object, power or peer approval. This parental challenge is a significant part of the growth process of children and everyone agrees that, although it should not be discouraged, it should not be without consequence. This is how children learn right from wrong, acceptable from unacceptable. However, there are few issues parents feel more strongly about than those regarding the discipline and punishment of their children. Although people may use those terms interchangeably, they mean quite different things. The definition of discipline shows it is the process of teaching a child the difference between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Good discipline should be a positive force, focusing on what a child is allowed to do. The goal of discipline is to help a child change impulsive, random behaviour into controlled, purposeful behaviour, and discipline should be reinforced with teaching, firmness, and reminders. Corporal punishment is one technique of discipline. It may be physical &#8211; a spank or slap; or psychological - disapproval, isolation from others, or withdrawal of privileges. The goal of punishment is to inhibit unacceptable behaviour.</div><div><br></div><div>There is a significant group within society that supports the use of corporal punishment, though most supporters believe in its mild application. They believe that mild corporal punishment used sparingly within a nurturing environment teaches a child that one can press the patience of others past a point of reasonable endurance. The theory is that corporal punishment can serve to emphasise parental conviction, clear the air between parent and child, and relieve parental frustration when a child&#8217;s behaviour is especially exasperating. Supporters are careful to point out, however, that corporal punishment should not be used in instances when a child&#8217;s behaviour is beyond her control or truly accidental, such as spilling milk.</div><div><br></div><div>The overwhelming majority nowadays oppose corporal punishment in any form. The view is that corporal punishment used as a method of discipline can result in undesirable and even damaging consequences. It is said that corporal punishment does not affect misbehaviour, and takes the responsibility for the misconduct away from the child. Child psychologist Anna Westin explains. &#8220;Children need to be accountable for their own behaviour in order to learn the inner control necessary to function as healthy, self-disciplined individuals. A child who is punished with spankings, shouts, and threats may learn how to avoid these punishments simply by not misbehaving in that particular way within sight of the person who punishes. There is no guarantee that the child&#8217;s behaviour will be changed over time or when he or she is away from the person who punishes him or her.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div>Another criticism of corporal punishment is that it may lead to a child viewing punishment as an endorsement of aggression, and learning only that a large person has power over a smaller one. Corporal punishment may also arouse feelings of resentment, counter-aggression, and deep humiliation and a child may develop unfeeling attitudes toward another person&#8217;s pain. Corporal punishment also increases the possibility of incidents of abuse, as it can be difficult for a parent to judge the severity of the punishment.</div><div><br></div><div>It is helpful to keep in mind the goals people have for children. If the goal is to help children learn to control their impulses and become self-directed adults, they must be helped by expanding the discipline repertoire to include more than mild punishments that serve only as temporary stopgap measures. This, however, does not need to include corporal punishment. It can be done, for example, by accompanying a mild punishment with a verbal explanation stating specifically what the child did wrong and what she can do to correct the misbehaviour in the future. Explaining to the child so that he/she can understand why the misbehaviour is not allowed makes the child think about acceptable versus unacceptable behaviour and helps him or her learn to make decisions about his or her own behaviour. This should not be confused with trying to get the child to be &#8220;reasonable.&#8221; A child does not need to agree that parental rules are reasonable in order to abide by them. It is widely agreed that, ultimately, older children will do the right thing, not because they fear external reprisal, but because they have internalised a standard initially presented by parents and other care-takers. In learning to rely on their own resources rather than their parents, children gain self-confidence and a positive self-image.</div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, it is clear that corporal punishment can be an emotive issue. Many nations have now made it illegal and so parents do not really have a choice of whether to use it or not, unless they wish to break the law of their country. What is clear though is that discussion of this issue will always begin again as every new generation comes into the world.</div>",

          "content": "<b>The Threats to Scottish Salmon</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>Salmon have always had to cope with a variety of hazards in both freshwater and seawater environments in order to survive. Many threats are completely natural, like flash floods or predatory birds, larger fish and otters or seals. These threats have always existed, but it is the man-made dangers that have emerged over the last hundred years that are causing the real concern.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>One of the most significant threats to Scottish salmon comes from the Scottish salmon-farming industry. Farmed salmon production in the North Atlantic area has increased dramatically, particularly in Norway, but also on the west coasts of Ireland and in the sea lochs of the Scottish Highlands. This has led to various problems. The first is that fish farms have created high concentrations of sea lice, which multiply in the confined conditions of sea rearing cages. Wild migrating sea trout and salmon smolts can be very vulnerable to attack by these lice. In addition to the sea lice, there is an increase in the risk of the spread of salmon disease or parasitic infestation, such as infectious salmon anaemia and Gyrodactylus salaris. Another problem is that escapees of farmed fish are known to be able to interbreed with wild fish. Since stocks in individual rivers are locally adapted to optimise their survival, this interbreeding has been shown to reduce the fitness of wild stocks for their indigenous environment. Salmon farming also has led to pollution of the water environment through uneaten food, fish faeces, or medications used to treat farmed salmon in their cages.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>Pollution is a key factor in the survival of the Scottish Atlantic salmon. To be healthy, Atlantic salmon need cool, clean water that contains a lot of oxygen. Chemicals, oil and rubbish can all pollute a river and, if hot water is released into a stream, the water temperature may become too warm for the salmon and they will die. Problems with spawning can be caused by cattle walking in the river and stirring up mud, which can stick spawning gravels together and make it difficult for the salmon to make redds. Riverbank erosion, overgrazing and deforestation can likewise lead to mud being washed into streams and rivers, leading again to the gravel clogging. Afforestation can be another problem. If conifers are planted alongside rivers, the acidic needles can increase the acidity of the water, upsetting the natural balance. Conifers also block out light and prevent beneficial vegetation from growing alongside the rivers. Finally, organic pollution in the form of silage and slurry run off from farmland can cause problems in rivers. This increase in nutrients causes too many plants to grow in the water. Their subsequent decomposition leads to an excess of bacteria in the water, which uses up oxygen so that there is a fall in the amount of oxygen available for the Atlantic salmon.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>In the sea, there are fisheries for lots of different kinds of fish. Sometimes, when a fishing boat is trying to catch one kind of fish, it will capture by-catch, which can include accidentally caught salmon smolts. Often, by the time a fishing boat realises it has caught the wrong type of fish, the fish are already dead. As salmon smolts move as a group in the sea, a fishing boat can sometimes catch (and kill) a lot of smolts all at once. Overfishing of fish that the salmon feed on also leads to depleted stocks of food for the salmon.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>Sometimes biologists call plants and animals aliens when they are found living somewhere where they would not occur naturally. One alien species that causes a problem for salmon is the American signal crayfish. This creature has been introduced to some rivers in Scotland, although it normally lives in North America. The crayfish is a predator, eating insects, fish eggs, fry and larger fish. The crayfish is not a normal part of the food chain in Scottish rivers and by eating these foods, it changes the way that energy moves through rivers. It also creates burrows in riverbanks, which make the banks weak and more likely to collapse.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>There are specific fisheries in the sea that target adult salmon returning from their feeding areas. Fishing here takes place in parts of the sea that do not belong to any one country and are called high seas fisheries. Adult salmon coming back to Scotland will tend to use the same general migration route across the sea, before choosing to go down either the west or east coast to return to their home river. It is when they are crossing the sea in a big group that they are vulnerable to high seas fisheries that track and plan the migration routes. In addition, once they follow the coast back to their home river, they can be caught in nets.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>Climate change is thought to have already had some effects upon Scottish Atlantic salmon and this may be partly to blame for decreasing numbers. There is also particular evidence that the temperature of the top of the sea may affect smolt survival. Climate change can affect salmon in different ways. It can alter their development rates and make their food less available. The numbers of fish and animals that hunt salmon may also be positively affected by temperature. Scientists do not know exactly what might happen if climate change continues and they are undertaking research to try and predict what might happen to Atlantic salmon under a variety of different climate conditions.</div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div><br></div><div>Smolt &#8211; Young salmon over three years&#8217; old</div><div><br></div><div>Lice &#8211; A type of parasite that feeds on salmon</div><div><br></div><div>Spawning &#8211; The release of eggs by fish</div><div><br></div><div>Redd &#8211; A small depression in a riverbed in which salmon will lay their eggs</div><div><br></div><div>Fry &#8211; Young fish</div>",

Metallic aluminium was first isolated in 1829 from aluminium chloride, but it was not commercially produced until 1886.</div><div><br></div><div>Aluminium is a silvery-white, tough, but lightweight metal. It is a good conductor of electricity as well as being very resistant to atmospheric corrosion and, because of these properties, it has become an important metal. In addition, aluminium alloys combine lightness with strength and, as a result, are used in a great variety of industries. In most countries, the construction industry is the most important consumer, though the car industry is also a major user.</div><div><br></div><div>Named after the French district of Les Baux, where it was first discovered in 1821, bauxite is produced by tropical or semitropical weathering of alumina-bearing rocks. It occurs over a variety of rocks as a weathered cover or blanket known as laterite. Because of the way it forms, bauxite deposits are generally very extensive. Bauxite is found on almost every continent, with the largest known economic resources being in Australia and the Republic of Guinea. In terms of ranking, these countries are followed by Brazil, Jamaica, and India. Although the USA, Japan, and Germany are the world&#8217;s largest consumers of aluminium, they possess little or no bauxite deposits of their own.</div><div><br></div><div>Extraction of aluminium metal takes place in three main stages - the mining of bauxite ore, refining the ore to recover alumina and the smelting of alumina to produce aluminium. Bauxite is mined by surface methods, in which the topsoil and overburden are removed by bulldozers and scrapers. This is then usually used for re-vegetating the area and returning it to a sometimes better than original condition or converting it to agricultural land. The underlying bauxite is mined by front-end loaders, power shovels or hydraulic excavators. Sometimes, the bauxite is crushed and washed to remove some of the clay and sand waste and then dried in rotary kilns. Other bauxite may just be crushed or dried. The ore is then loaded into trucks, railway cars or onto conveyor belts and transported to refineries.</div><div><br></div><div>In almost all commercial refineries, alumina is extracted from bauxite by the Bayer refining process. The process, devised by Karl Bayer in 1888, consists of four stages: digestion, clarification, precipitation and calcination. All commercial production of aluminium from alumina is based on the Hall-Heroult smelting process, in which the aluminium and oxygen in the alumina are separated. This is done by passing an electric current through a molten solution of alumina and natural or synthetic cryolite. An inexpensive source of electricity is essential for the economic production of aluminium with this process.</div><div><br></div><div>The aluminium industry initiated the development of technology for recycling aluminium- containing material and for setting up drink can collection centres. One of the industry&#8217;s main incentives has been the reduced amount of energy it takes to produce one tonne of secondary aluminium compared with one tonne of primary aluminium. This involves a saving of ninety-five per cent of the energy required to produce molten aluminium from bauxite.</div><div><br></div><div>Cans are probably the most common aluminium consumer items to be recycled. The life cycle of an aluminium beverage can is just sixty days from &#8220;can to can.&#8221; In this short time, a beverage can goes from the grocery store shelf to the consumer, and then on to a recycling facility where it can be re-melted into can sheet and reformed into another aluminium beverage can with exactly the same physical characteristics as the original can. Because aluminium can be recycled with no degradation in quality, aluminium cans are the ideal product for a closed-loop approach to recycling.</div><div><br></div><div>In the first step of recycling, bales of aluminium cans are shredded into pieces the size of a walnut in a 1,000-horsepower shredder. The shreds are then passed through a separator to remove any steel using magnetism that may have been mixed into the bale. Following the can shredding process, any lacquer or paint on the aluminium is removed by blowing hot air at around 550 degrees Celsius through the shreds on a slowly moving insulated conveyor. The exhaust gases from this process are first passed through an afterburner and are then used to heat incoming process air via a heat exchanger, minimising the energy requirements of the system. After being de-coated, the aluminium shreds are then fed into melting furnaces containing submerged stirrers that create a vortex in the pool of molten aluminium and drag the shreds quickly down into the melt. This process realises rapid melting rates and high yields. The molten metal is then transferred into a holding furnace, where it is treated to remove impurities before casting the aluminium. Ingots are cast by tilting the holding furnace and pouring the molten metal into a casting unit. The metal is treated in a two-stage process to remove any remaining microscopic non-metallic particles and gases, with chemical composition and metal cleanliness tested on each cast. As the metal flows into the moulds, it is chilled by jets of cool water pumped around and through the base of the mould. The aluminium ingot solidifies gradually during the casting process, which takes approximately three hours. The finished 18-ton ingots, each containing approximately 1.5 million used cans, are shipped to a mill for rolling into the sheet from which aluminium can makers subsequently produce new cans. Then the whole process begins again.</div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div><br></div><div>Overburden - any soil or rock that covers a mineral deposit</div>",

Many people regard aesthetic surgery as a panacea for their personal and relationship difficulties. Active and aggressive media, which were almost absent fifty years ago, have made our society ambitious, and the media have globalised the perception of what is attractive, desirable, and sexy.

As the concepts of beauty undergo change, wrinkles, fat deposits and sun-damaged skin no longer fit into our concept of a neat society. Now that these real or perceived ageing problems receive greater attention from patients and doctors, the ethical considerations also need to be focused upon. Enhancement versus therapy, risks, patient autonomy, beneficence and informed consent are issues that need to be reconsidered and emphasised when considering aesthetic surgery. Principles that could help guide health care professionals include a respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice.</div><div><br></div><div>In general, competent adults have the right to decide whether they wish to undergo a surgical procedure or not. The patients&#8217; wishes and thereby their right to an informed decision have to be taken into account, provided they have been given sufficient information, which must include the risks together with alternative options. These principles apply even more to aesthetic operations, where patients are not suffering from any &#8216;illness&#8217;. These treatments, which may lead to long-term adverse effects on body function and health, involve serious ethical concerns. In such situations, the patient&#8217;s right for autonomy may contradict the physician&#8217;s principle of non-maleficence, and therefore, proper consideration is needed before deciding on such treatments. Surgeons must therefore ensure that the patients&#8217; expectations are reasonable.</div><div><br></div><div>The beneficence principle requires that medical practitioners act in the best interests of patients. Undertaking surgery to improve a patient&#8217;s self-image and esteem is acceptable. However, defining the patient&#8217;s best interests can be very difficult. Many people are extremely self- conscious about their appearance and these groups may benefit from aesthetic surgery. Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a psychiatric syndrome, characterised by a preoccupation with a non-existent or minimal cosmetic &#8216;defect&#8217; associated with persistent attempts to have the defect surgically corrected. BDD is increasingly recognised, and may be becoming more prevalent.</div><div><br></div><div>The principle of non-maleficence ensures that an aesthetic surgeon never acts against a patient&#8217;s welfare or in a way that may harm a patient. Consultant aesthetic surgeons may decline to operate on patients if they do not believe that the surgery is to the patients&#8217; benefit.</div><div><br></div><div>Aesthetic surgeons should be reluctant to operate on those with unrealistic expectations, as the risks of surgery may outweigh any benefits. Patients with serious health problems are also at increased risk of complications under general anaesthesia, and again the risks may outweigh the benefits. All such assessments need to be made on an individual basis. In the past, there has been a perception that surgeons have a potential conflict of interest in the independent sector. No surgeon should ever proceed with an operation merely for personal pecuniary gain. All aesthetic surgeons need to take their duty of care to their patients very seriously.</div><div><br></div><div>The justice principle requires doctors to ensure that medical care is available to all. Equitable access to healthcare is regarded by many as a basic entitlement. However, resources are limited and it is not possible for any health service to provide aesthetic surgery for all those who would like it. Rationing takes place on the basis of clinical necessity. Inevitably, this introduces subjective judgement about whose need is greater. In the private sector, those who can afford to pay undergo surgery.</div><div><br></div><div>Requests for aesthetic surgery occur in all social classes. However, as stated earlier, because of economic considerations, there are no social systems in the world that covers aesthetic surgery, except for some particular interventions. The case of adolescents is especially problematic. The deformity, physical and emotional maturity and the desired outcome for each adolescent patient must be carefully evaluated before any decisions are made. Additional consultations and long discussions before aesthetic surgery are always necessary and this may require expert psychological assessment.</div><div><br></div><div>At present, aesthetic surgery is passing through an identity crisis as well as posing an acute ethical dilemma. A closer look from an ethical viewpoint makes it evident that the doctor who offers aesthetic interventions faces many serious ethical problems to do with the identity of the surgeon as a healer. Aesthetic surgery makes profit from the ideology of a society that serves only vanity, youthfulness and personal success, and one which is losing sight of the real values. The real value of a person cannot be reduced to his/her appearance, and medicine as an art should feel the obligation to resist these modern ideologies and should attempt to help people get a more realistic attitude about themselves. Plastic surgeons must resist aesthetic measures in children and adolescents, particularly operations which are totally cosmetic. Nevertheless, exceptions do exist and convincing arguments may support aesthetic measures with children and adolescents to prevent stigmatisation in selected cases.</div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div><br></div><div>Panacea - a cure for everything</div><div><br></div><div>Non-maleficence - non-harming or inflicting the least harm possible to reach a beneficial outcome</div>",

          "content": "Antarctica, like all large landmasses, contains minerals, oil and gas. There is no government of Antarctica in the way that people understand it in the rest of the world. This is largely because there are no indigenous inhabitants; the only habitations are scientific stations that people visit for short time periods, usually from a couple of months to just over a year. The current status of mining in the Antarctic is the result of a complex history involving a variety of disciplines &#8211; geology, economics and the politics of international agreements.<div><br></div><div>The Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic, also known as The Madrid Protocol, bans all mineral resource activities in Antarctica other than for the purpose of research. Mining was banned in Antarctica for a variety of reasons, but mainly because mining poses a real menace to the ecological integrity of the continent. This protocol was not the first negotiated relating to Antarctica. In the 1980&#8217;s, the question of possible mineral exploitation (including the extraction of oil and gas) was addressed by the nations of the Antarctic Treaty. The participants negotiated an agreement called the Convention on the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities (CRAMRA), which would have regulated mining should it have ever been contemplated. CRAMRA, however, did not come into force, as the Madrid Protocol came into effect instead.</div><div><br></div><div>Mining in Antarctica would be difficult. A common way of commencing mineral exploration elsewhere is to pan for gold or heavy metals or minerals in rivers. More detailed exploration involves river water sampling to locate likely ore bodies. Antarctica, however, does not have many rivers, and those that do exist are very small, seasonal and drain limited areas. Thus, heavy mineral placer deposits are very unlikely. Similarly, because of the different oceanographic conditions and lack of beaches, the heavy mineral beach sands so important in Australia are unavailable. In addition to this, there are various other problems facing possible mining in Antarctica: the cold, the ice covering land and sea, drifting icebergs that could collide with platforms and mining infrastructure, the remoteness from inhabited places and the sheer cost of operations.</div><div><br></div><div>Minerals have been discovered in Antarctica as a result of geological studies. However, there are some features of Antarctica that dramatically reduce the chance of mineral availability. Firstly, ninety-eight per cent of the continent is overlain by ice up to four kilometres thick and thus very little area is accessible for exploration. Secondly, many types of minerals that are important elsewhere on Earth cannot be expected in Antarctica. Thirdly, certain mineral occurrences, such as bauxite (the ore of aluminium), some iron ores or even some nickel-bearing laterites are formed by the long-term leaching of a parent rock. As a result, virtually all of the parent is altered and dissolved away to leave a commonly soft, insoluble residue. Antarctica does not have the weathering conditions (it is too cold) nor the dissolving power (water is almost absent) to create this leaching, and glacial activity removes anything soft or that was formed in ages past.</div><div><br></div><div>Another related occurrence missing from Antarctica is &#8216;supergene enrichment&#8217; to produce a porous, iron-rich surface material known as gossans. These form over some ore bodies, (very often even where no valuable ore exists at depth) and often cover a larger area than the ore body. These aid geologists in locating where ore may be found. A feature of such supergene enrichments is that, as the parent rocks weather, through water and other action, the residual gossans are enriched in gold and some forms of copper, including native copper. Such supergene enrichments are absent from Antarctica because of unfavourable weathering conditions and their removal by moving ice. Therefore, any mineral search in Antarctica would need to find the parent ore body directly, a very difficult proposition.</div><div><br></div><div>Some scientists have claimed that, due to extremely unusual oceanic circumstances around Antarctica, some yet unknown mechanisms may be concentrating minerals. However, there is no evidence of this so far. An argument often asserted to suggest that East Antarctica is mineral-rich is based on the fact that if continents were placed in their original location in the ancient supercontinent of Gondwana, parts would lie against the mineral rich ancient rocks of Western Australia. However, along the south coast of Western Australia is the Albany-Fraser block, which has almost totally defied concerted efforts to find mineral wealth. The geological story of West Antarctica is very different, but the mineral resource potential seems also to be very low.</div><div><br></div><div>The Antarctic Peninsula, the main exposed part of West Antarctica, was formed by complex processes nearly 200 million years ago as the seafloor was subducted under the Peninsula. This process has also occurred in New Zealand and along the west coast of South America. The process formed the rich copper ores of Chile, and hence the Peninsula has been theorised as a potential copper province. Again, the facts do not support this hypothesis. Copper in Chile only occurs north of the capital Santiago, not along the entire west coast of South America.</div><div><br></div><div>There are minerals, coal and almost certainly oil in Antarctica and under the surrounding seas. At the moment, it is not economically viable to attempt to recover them. In the future, however, as technology improves and especially if global warming leads to deglacierisation and reduced sea- ice, thus exposing more areas and improving access, recovery of at least some of these natural resources will take place.</div><div><br></div><div><u>Glossary</u></div><div><br></div><div>To subduct &#8211; the geological verb that describes how one tectonic plate moves under another tectonic plate and sinks into the mantle as the plates converge</div>",

          "content": "<b>The Slow Destruction of the Zachariae Isstrom Glacier</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>The Zachariae Isstrom glacier is the latest in a string of Greenland glaciers to undergo rapid change in the warming world. A new NASA study has found that Zachariae Isstrom has broken loose from a glaciologically stable position and entered a phase of accelerated retreat. It is expected that the consequences will be felt for decades to come.</div><div><br></div><div>The reason for these long-term effects is the size of the Zachariae Isstrom glacier. It drains ice from an area of 91,780 square kilometres, which is about 5 per cent of the Greenland Ice Sheet. All by itself, it holds enough water to raise global sea level by 46 centimetres if it were to melt completely. The Zachariae Isstrom glacier is currently crumbling, losing 5 billion tons of mass every year, which is disintegrating into the North Atlantic Ocean. Jeremy Close, one of the researchers on the NASA study, explains: &#8220;North Greenland glaciers are changing rapidly and especially the form and dynamics of Zachariae Isstrom have been transformed over the last few years. The melting glacier will now result in rising sea levels for decades to come.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div>The cause of the change in the Zachariae Isstrom glacier is solely due to warmer water temperatures. Greenland marine scientist Sophie Boldt explains the situation. &#8220;The warmer waters have caused the end of the glacier to float free from a ridge of bedrock below sea level on which it had rested until just recently. Without that natural brake, the glacier is now sliding more quickly and more icebergs are snapping off, adding a net five billion tonnes of ice a year to the oceans.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div>The NASA team used data from aerial surveys conducted by NASA and satellite-based observations acquired by multiple international space agencies coordinated by the Polar Space Task Group. The various tools used, including a highly sensitive radar sounder, gravimeter and laser profiling systems, coupled with radar and optical photographs from satellites, monitored and recorded changes in the shape, size and position of glacial ice over long time periods. This provided precise data on the state of Earth&#8217;s polar regions. The scientists determined the bottom of Zachariae Isstrom is being rapidly eroded by warmer ocean water mixed with growing amounts of melt water from the ice sheet surface. &#8220;Ocean warming has played a sole role in triggering the glacier&#8217;s retreat,&#8221; said section leader Joanna Morgan, &#8220;but we need more oceanographic observations in this critical sector of Greenland to determine the glacier&#8217;s prognosis.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div>Adjacent to Zachariae Isstrom is another large glacier that is also melting rapidly, but is receding at a slower rate because it is protected by an inland hill. The two glaciers make up twelve per cent of the Greenland ice sheet and would boost global sea levels by more than ninety-nine centimetres if they fully collapsed. The sector where these two glaciers reside is one of three major marine-based basins in Greenland, along with Jakobshavn Isbrae in central west Greenland and the Petermann-Humboldt sector in central north Greenland. Glaciologist, Tom Ellis, explains that&#160;potential danger is imminent within the latter two areas. &#8220;The Jakobshavn Isbrae and the Petermann-Humboldt basins hold enough water to raise global sea level by over half a metre each, and both are also undergoing significant changes related to warming at present. Even a small increase in sea levels can have devastating effects on shoreline habitats, and half a metre is not a small increase.&#8221; As rising seawater reaches farther inland, it can cause destructive erosion, flooding of wetlands, contamination of aquifers and agricultural soils, and lost habitat for fish, birds, and plants. In addition, hundreds of millions of people live in areas that will become increasingly vulnerable to flooding. Higher sea levels would force them to abandon their homes and relocate. Low-lying islands could be submerged completely. One of the NASA study&#8217;s authors, Paulina Weiler, summarises the study&#8217;s conclusion. &#8220;It is likely that many of these Greenland glaciers will lose their ice shelves in coming years, further increasing Greenland&#8217;s future contributions to global sea level rise. It is unlikely that world governments will take the necessary decisions to stop the melting and it is actually moot whether any action taken now would create the required changes in time.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div>The actual process of polar glacier iceberg calving into the sea is similar in most situations of glaciers that are situated next to the sea. First of all, the glacier must, of course, extend into the sea. This part has usually become rather thin, due to relatively warm circumpolar water that flows in from the deep and causes melting to the underside of the glacier. This water is cooled and then moves away from the sub-ice cavity in shallower water. The warm water continues to erode the underside of the glacier, particularly at the grounding line, which is where the glacier comes into contact with glaciomarine muds, on which it rests. The weight of the thinning glacier as it extends into the sea causes crevasses to form on the top side and these will in turn snap off and calve the icebergs of the future. Higher up in the glacier, ice thinning is present and these fractures will eventually become the crevasses lower down.</div>",

          "content": "<b>Hybrid Cars</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Most people these days are now aware of the real possibility of choosing to buy a hybrid car. Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are powered by an internal combustion engine or other propulsion source that can be run on conventional or alternative fuel and an electric motor that uses energy stored in a battery. HEVs combine the benefits of high fuel economy and low emissions with the power and range of conventional vehicles. A wide variety of hybrid electric vehicles is currently available. Although HEVs are often more expensive than similar conventional vehicles, some costs may be recovered through fuel savings or state incentives. HEVs are powered by an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, which uses energy stored in batteries. The extra power provided by the electric motor allows for a smaller engine. Additionally, the battery can power auxiliary loads like sound systems and headlights and reduce engine idling when stopped. Together, these features result in better fuel economy without sacrificing performance.</div><div><br></div><div>HEVs can be either mild or full hybrids, and full hybrids can be designed in series or parallel configurations. Mild hybrids, also called micro hybrids, use a battery and electric motor to help power the vehicle and can allow the engine to shut off when the vehicle stops (such as at traffic lights or in stop-and-go traffic), further improving fuel economy. Mild hybrid systems cannot power the vehicle using electricity alone. These vehicles generally cost less than full hybrids, but provide less substantial fuel economy benefits than full hybrids. Full hybrids have more powerful electric motors and larger batteries, which can drive the vehicle on just electric power for short distances and at low speeds. These systems cost more than mild hybrids, but provide better fuel economy benefits.</div><div><br></div><div>There are different ways to combine the power from the electric motor and the internal combustion engine. Parallel hybrids, for example, the most common HEV designs, can connect the internal combustion engine and the electric motor to the wheels through mechanical coupling. Both the electric motor and the internal combustion engine drive the wheels directly. Series hybrids, on the other hand, use only the electric motor to drive the wheels and are sometimes found in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles.</div><div><br></div><div>Hybrid cars have been around longer than most people realise. A man by the name of Goldsworthy Gurney invented a steam car in 1825, which made an 85-mile road trip in ten hours. In 1897, the London Electric Cab Company produced a fleet of cars known as the Bersey Cabs. This fleet was powered by a 40-cell battery and a three horsepower electric motor. Around the same time, the Pope Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut, manufactured approximately 500 electric cars over 2 years. Within the first few years of the twentieth century, thousands of electric and hybrid cars were manufactured, but when Henry Ford introduced the assembly line approach to manufacturing cars along with the technology to produce a self-starting engine, the hybrid concept quickly declined.</div><div><br></div><div>The discussion of whether to buy a hybrid car revolves around a variety of issues. Firstly, a country that had a large number of hybrid cars would be less reliant on imported petroleum, which would increase the country&#8217;s energy security. Last year, for example, the United States imported about thirty-three per cent of the petroleum it consumed, and transportation was responsible for nearly three-quarters of total U.S. petroleum consumption. With much of the world&#8217;s petroleum reserves located in politically volatile countries, the United States is vulnerable to price spikes and supply disruptions. This has led many countries&#8217; governments to offer incentives to people owning a hybrid car.</div><div><br></div><div>Another advantage of HEVs is that they achieve better fuel economy and have lower fuel costs than similar conventional vehicles, although because they rely in whole or part on electric power, their fuel economy is measured differently than in conventional vehicles. It must be taken into account that the fuel economy of HEVs is highly dependent on the load carried and the duty cycle, but in the right applications, they can maintain a strong fuel-cost advantage over their conventional counterparts.</div><div><br></div><div>The environmental issue is often a deciding factor for those deciding about a hybrid car. Hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles can have significant emissions benefits over conventional vehicles. HEV emissions benefits vary by car model and type of hybrid power system. HEV&#8217;s also produce no tailpipe emissions when in all-electric mode.</div><div><br></div><div>One deterrent for people considering the purchase of a hybrid car is that retail prices are more expensive. While hybrids can save a lot of money on petrol, making the initial investment is often a bit more than some people are willing to make up front. A better way to look at it is as an investment in the future of our planet. People will also realise that they will recoup the difference over time and in the long run save money.</div><div><br></div><div>Another negative side for hybrid ownership is the fact that when a hybrid car is in an accident, it is more difficult for rescuers to get people out of the car due to the electric motor and the increased risk of electrocution. The cost of a replacement battery for hybrid cars has also been a concern in the past, with replacements costing thousands of dollars. It should be taken into consideration that these hybrid battery packs are made to last for the life of the car and the warranty covers batteries for somewhere between eight and ten years. The real concern with the batteries for many environmentally conscious folk is toxicity upon disposal. This does not need to be a concern nowadays, however, because most hybrids manufactured today use batteries that can be recycled without a problem.</div>",

          "content": "<b>Speed Cameras - Good or Bad?</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Speed cameras register the speeds of vehicles, working so that if a vehicle exceeds the speed limit, the camera will record the number plate and a fine will be issued. Supporters of speed cameras say that they reduce accidents and deaths, but critics say they are merely money generation machines.</div><div><br></div><div>New research carried out by a team based at an Australian University claims it has produced evidence to support the use of speed cameras. Dr. Tim Stephan explains. &#8220;Although our research was conducted in only three towns, our findings show that, when speed cameras are in place, the number of vehicles that exceed local speed limits is lower, and the number of collisions and the number of people killed or injured are also reduced.&#8221; These results are topical, because the Australian government has recently claimed that local authorities could have relied too heavily on speed cameras to reduce numbers of road crashes.</div><div><br></div><div>Sarah Colley gives further support, saying it&#8217;s not just the speed itself that is bad. &#8220;Inappropriate speed also intensifies other driver errors, such as driving too close or driving when fatigued or distracted, multiplying the chances of these types of driving causing an accident. Even where speed is not the main factor in a crash, it fundamentally affects both the likelihood of the crash occurring, and its severity for those involved.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div>There are also financial arguments for speed cameras, but not just the revenue generation aspect. UK civil servant Sophie Anderson explains. &#8220;Road accidents are extremely expensive in financial terms, both for those involved and for local governments. Safety cameras more than pay for themselves, and so from a purely financial point of view, cutting them does not make sense.&#8221; Statistics seem to support Anderson&#8217;s point. A four-year evaluation of the national safety camera programme estimated that the annual economic benefit of cameras in place at the end of the fourth year was over &#163;258 million, compared with enforcement costs of about &#163;96 million. Most savings came from less infrastructure and time needed to deal with accidents.</div><div><br></div><div>The police claim that cameras are not about money generation. Police chief Mark Cameron makes the point. &#8220;Cameras are an effective way of identifying drivers who would benefit from attending a Speed Awareness Course, and so they provide a good opportunity to re-educate, and not just punish drivers who are caught speeding. Even when drivers are fined and given penalty points, this acts as a warning to the driver to consider his or her driving before they run the risk of being disqualified after being caught too often.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div>John Thatcher, an anti-speed camera campaigner, explains the counter arguments. &#8220;Statistics from different local governments show a slight reduction in accident numbers in the nine months since the devices were removed in some towns. This is evidence that speed cameras have a minimal effect on road safety, and are simply a means of generating cash for local governments.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div>Naturally, strong supporters of speed cameras are the companies that manufacture them. These companies have been criticised sometimes for their cynical tactics in introducing speed cameras. Councillor Jim Beaton clarifies. &#8220;It&#8217;s easy to quiet opposition of speed cameras by saying that the cameras will be installed in school zones. Who wants to be seen as being against improving the safety of children? What the ticket camera companies fail to mention is that they intend to use the school zone cameras to make it easier to push them through everywhere else later. They also don&#8217;t mention that many of these school zone speed cameras are in use 24/7, 365 days a year, even if school isn&#8217;t in session.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div>In response to statistics opposing speed cameras, some local governments have shut them down. This does not mean though that the decision makers don&#8217;t change their minds. Tom Ellison, the mayor of one New Zealand city, has returned backing for decommissioned speed cameras to support cyclists. &#8220;While the number of those killed or seriously injured on our roads has reduced recently, there are still too many incidents, especially those involving pedestrians and cyclists and I have asked officers to start work on preparing speed cameras to be switched back on. These measures will boost other efforts to improve the way we all get around the city, such as the forty kph zones that are currently being rolled out.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div>One different criticism of speed cameras is that they affect drivers&#8217; behaviour. Pete Best, a road safety expert explains. &#8220;When a lot of people see speed cameras, they panic break and slow down their cars more quickly than they would normally be expected to on a road. This can lead to the car behind going into the car in front. On roads with higher speed limits, this can lead to cars travelling at markedly different speeds, leading to accidents, rather than preventing them. Road safety is not measured in miles an hour. People should be encouraged to drive safely, rather than just slowly.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div>It doesn&#8217;t look like supporters and opponents of speed cameras are going to agree any time soon. However, at a local radio discussion recently, Mrs. Sharon Davis, a telephone caller, made a point that cuts through a lot of the rhetoric. &#8220;If all motorists complied with the law and drove within the speed limit in the first place, there would be no need for speed cameras.&#8221; This is true and maybe it&#8217;s just down to everyone to drive according to the law.</div>",

          "content": "<b>Glass through the Ages</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>From our earliest origins, man has been making use of glass. Archaeologists have discovered that a form of natural glass was the first use of it by man as tips for spears. This was obsidian, which was formed within the mouth of a volcano as a result of sand melting in the intense heat of an eruption. Archaeologists have also found evidence of man-made glass which dates back to 4000 BC. It was not until 1500 BC that the first hollow glass container was made by covering a sand core with a layer of molten glass.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>Glass blowing became the most common way to make glass containers from the First Century BC. However, the glass made during this time was highly coloured, due to the impurities of the raw material. It was not until the First Century AD that colourless glass was first produced and then it could be purposely coloured by the addition of colouring materials. The Romans were accomplished glass makers, however, the skills and technology required to make glass were closely guarded by them and it was not until the Roman Empire disintegrated that skills for glass making spread throughout Europe and the Middle East. Later, the Venetians in particular gained a reputation for technical skill and artistic ability in the making of glass bottles, and a fair number of the city&#8217;s craftsmen left Italy to set up glassworks throughout Europe. A major milestone in the history of glass occurred with the invention of lead crystal glass by Englishman George Ravenscroft. He attempted to counter the effect of clouding, that sometimes occurred in blown glass by introducing lead to the raw materials used in the process. The new glass he created was softer and easier to decorate and had a higher refractive index, adding to its brilliance and beauty, and it proved invaluable to the optical industry. It&#8217;s thanks to Ravenscroft&#8217;s invention that optical lenses, astronomical telescopes, microscopes and the like became possible.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>The modern glass industry only really started to develop in Britain after the repeal of the Excise Act in 1845 relieved the heavy duty that had been enforced. Before that time, excise duties were placed on the amount of glass melted in a glasshouse and this was levied continuously from 1745 to 1845. From 1848, glass was allowed to be manufactured on a larger scale and this led to its larger use in buildings. Joseph Paxton&#8217;s Crystal Palace at the Great Exhibition of 1851 marked the beginning of the discovery of glass as a building material. The revolutionary new building encouraged the use of glass in public, domestic and horticultural architecture. Early use of building glass was of course to allow vision whilst providing protection from the environment. The glass used in today&#8217;s windows and facades has more functions, such as security, self-cleaning and fire and noise resistance.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>Modern glass making is a hi-tech industry operating in a fiercely competitive global market where quality, design and service levels are critical to maintaining market share. Modern glass plants are capable of making millions of glass containers a day in many different colours, although &#8220;clear&#8221; remains the most in demand. Few people can imagine modern life without glass. It features in almost every aspect of our lives - in our homes, our cars and whenever we sit down to eat or drink. Glass packaging is used for many products. Due to its ability to be sterile, most drinks can come in glass, as can medicines and cosmetics, not to mention numerous foodstuffs.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>With increasing consumer concern for the environment, glass has again come into its own proving itself to be an ideal material for recycling. Glass makes up a large component of household and industrial waste due to its weight and density. The glass component in municipal waste is usually made up of bottles, broken glassware, light bulbs and other items. Adding to this waste is the fact that many manual methods of creating glass objects have a defect rate of around forty percent. Glass recycling is good news for the environment. It saves used glass containers being sent to landfill and less energy is needed to melt recycled glass than to melt down the raw materials, thus saving energy. Every 1,000 tonnes of recycled glass that is used in this way saves 345,000 kWh of energy, 314 tonnes of CO2, 1,200 tonnes of raw material and 1,000 tonnes of landfill. Recycling also reduces the need for raw materials to be quarried, thus saving precious resources. After glass is collected, it is crushed and melted, and then moulded into new products such as bottles and jars. It may also be used for alternative purposes such as brick manufacture.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>Glass as a material in its own right will always exist. Also, many new applications and manufacturing processes will involve glass in combination with other materials. With the increasing sophistication of opto-electronic devices, there is an increasing need to combine optical and electronic devices for many applications, such as transmission of audio, video and data information. Glasses and ceramics, either alone or composite with other materials, will find increasing application in biological and medical areas. Materials such as photochromic, electrochromic and thermochromic glasses, which respond to external stimuli, are being developed with various and sometimes unusual applications.</div>",

          "content": "<b>Building the Hoover Dam</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>On July 7th 1930, the construction of the Hoover Dam began. Over the next five years, a total of twenty-one thousand men would work ceaselessly to produce what would be the largest dam, as well as one of the largest man-made structures of its time.</div><div><br></div><div>Although the dam would take only five years to build, its construction was nearly thirty years in the making. Arthur Powell Davis, an engineer from the Bureau of Reclamation, originally drew up his engineering report for the Hoover Dam back in 1902, and it was this that was the basis of the construction project, when plans were finally made to begin the dam in 1922.</div><div><br></div><div>Herbert Hoover, the 31st president of the United States and a committed conservationist, played a crucial role in making Davis&#8217; vision a reality. As secretary of commerce in 1921, Hoover devoted himself to what would become the Hoover Dam in Boulder Canyon, Colorado. The dam would supply flood control, which would prevent damage to downstream farming communities that suffered each year when snow from the Rocky Mountains melted and joined the Colorado River. The dam would allow better farming opportunities with the expansion of irrigation in the desert, and it would also provide a supply of water and electricity for the city of Los Angeles and other towns of southern California. The Boulder Dam generates, on average, 4 billion kilowatt-hours of hydroelectric power each year for use in Nevada, Arizona, and California - enough to serve 1.3 million people. From 1939 to 1949, the Boulder Powerplant was the world&#8217;s largest hydroelectric installation and today it is still one of the largest in the US.</div><div><br></div><div>Even with Hoover&#8217;s backing and a regional consensus regarding the need to build the dam, congressional approval and individual state cooperation were slow in coming. For many years, Colorado River water rights had been a source of contention among the western states bordering it. To address this issue, Hoover negotiated the Colorado River Compact, which broke the river basin into two regions. Hoover then had to introduce and re-introduce the bill to build the dam several times over the next few years, before the House and Senate finally approved it in 1928. Once negotiations and preparations were made, the Hoover Dam&#8217;s construction went forward quickly. The contractors finished their work two years ahead of schedule and millions of dollars under budget.</div><div><br></div><div>Just before the onset of building, the dam location was shifted from Boulder Canyon to Black Canyon. The United States&#8217; Great Depression ensured that there were plenty of men in need of work, who would come to this desolate, wild, and hot area to earn a living. Arriving with families, a tent community was born. No electricity, an average temperature of 119 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) during the day, poor sanitary conditions and poor water set the stage for communities known as &#8220;Ragtowns.&#8221; In order to improve their quality of life and to save people from disease, electricity came to the area and Boulder City was established. A school, church, post office and other supporting facilities were created for the families.</div><div><br></div><div>Before the dam construction could begin, the Colorado river needed to be re-routed through tunnels. This would allow the water to bypass the dam foundation site and later on to be used for the electric plant generators. Building tunnels directly through the canyon rock walls required dynamite, rock removal and structure for support to be built. Great hazards were created in the tunnels. The use of machines could cause carbon monoxide poisoning and, of course, there was the blasting and drilling in the rock, which was also dangerous work. Once the first two tunnels were in place, cofferdams were built to divert the Colorado River. These two cofferdams were constructed in order to isolate the construction site, and protect it from flooding. Before the cofferdams could be constructed, 250,000 cubic yards of river silt had to first be removed to provide a firm foundation. Construction of the upper cofferdam began in September, 1932, even though the river had not yet been completely surveyed. Work on the lower cofferdam was delayed because of flooding. The cofferdams were completed before the spring floods of 1933 and the engineers watched nervously the dams successfully holding back the water. This allowed the dam construction to begin.</div><div><br></div><div>As in any construction project, the dam&#8217;s base was a major factor in building an enduring structure. This required the men to excavate the mud and muck at the river bottom. With the aid of power shovels, the men removed over half a million cubic yards to reach bedrock forty feet below. Simultaneously, the &#8220;high scalers&#8221; worked the canyon walls. Earning $5.60 a day, this was one of the highest paying jobs at the site. These men would blast the walls to create a smooth joining surface for the dam.</div><div><br></div><div>The hydroelectric system had to be included within the structure of the dam. For efficient use for power generation, the intake had to be as far above the turbines as possible (a high &#8216;head&#8217;). The water intake at the Boulder Dam comes in through filters half way down the dam&#8217;s wall. The water flows down through a waterway known as the penstock, until it comes into contact with the turbines. The water then flows down pipes to the bottom of the dam, where it rejoins the river. The turbines rotate long steel poles that go up to the generator, where the turning creates the magnetic field, which in turn generates electricity. The electricity leaves the generator and goes to a substation, before being carried by power lines to its places of use.</div>",

          "content": "<b>The Welsh in Argentina</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>In the middle of the 19th century, some individuals in Wales and the United States were inspired by the idea of establishing a Welsh settlement in Argentina. Their hope was that the Welsh could live and keep their language and traditions alive, without any external influences. At first sight, it is curious that some Welsh were of U.S. origin, but Welsh travelers had headed earlier towards North America. The problem in the U.S. was that American society had a strong influence on the language and traditions of Welsh migrants. Some therefore decided to set up colonies in other somewhat far-away places of the world, so that the lack of contact with other cultures would encourage the preservation of their own culture. They finally chose Patagonian Argentina, due to its isolation and because the Argentine government offered a grant of twenty-five acres of land per family.</div><div><br></div><div>Initially, it was problematic to raise funds and gather public support and the long negotiations with the Argentine government were very difficult. However, the first group of Welsh settlers finally began the long journey to Patagonia on the 28th May 1865. Some 150, in total, sailed from Liverpool on board the Mimosa.</div><div><br></div><div>The reality of life in Patagonia, a barren and inhospitable place, was to prove extremely challenging for the early settlers. The settlers had to face many adversities, such as bad harvests, floods and the lack of a direct way out to the ocean in order to sell their goods. Some of them, as a result, decided to emigrate to other areas. The population decreased and because of this, it became important that more Welsh came from Wales. Some of the settlers went back to Wales in order to convince them and two more waves took place during the years 1874 and 1876. In time, the settlers established their own Welsh-speaking communities, where they built farms and schools.</div><div><br></div><div>By the mid-twentieth century, the influx from Wales had ceased altogether and people of different cultural backgrounds from other parts of Argentina migrated to the territory. During this time, there was little connection between Wales and Patagonia, because of the two world wars, and the depression years of Argentina. The Welsh community was at that time in a minority and, when the first generations of Welsh colonists disappeared, the sense of relationship between Wales and Patagonia weakened and Welsh cultural activity was drastically reduced.</div><div><br></div><div>This decay of the settlers&#8217; Welsh traditions continued. Although Argentina had gained independence in 1816, it wasn&#8217;t until the 20th century that Spanish became the official language of the country. This and the process of the Argentinian authorities becoming actively involved in the governance of the settlement made the Welsh settlers more and more Argentinian and less and less Welsh. The number of people speaking Welsh in Patagonia also reduced rapidly during the early twentieth century. However, the 1960&#8217;s saw a revival in relations between Wales and Patagonia, which led to an increase in interest in all things Welsh amongst the descendants of the first settlers. Many Welsh people visited the region in 1965 to celebrate the colony&#8217;s centenary and since then, the number of Welsh visitors has increased.</div><div><br></div><div>Today, the Welsh Institute, which is responsible for gathering data on Welsh culture there, has reported that out of approximately 150,000 people living in the province where the Welsh areas of Patagonia are located, there are approximately 20,000 who are descendants of the Welsh. Many of them speak Welsh naturally, and many more are able to speak Welsh to differing levels. The latter are people and children, who either have received some amount of Welsh at home, or have learned Welsh as a second language in the classroom. Approximately six hundred people of all ages take up learning Welsh as a second language annually. The Welsh heritage of Patagonia is visible throughout the entire province, even in villages in the middle of the Patagonian desert, with Welsh names and signs seen in the street on the shop fronts. Educators are sent to teach the language and to train local tutors, and there is some sort of prestige in knowing the language, even among those who are not of Welsh descent. The Welsh language education is mainly funded by the Welsh government and other UK institutions.</div><div><br></div><div>It seems like a wonderful story, but not everyone agrees with this point of view. Academics researching aspects of Welsh involvement in Patagonia say the migration has to be seen now more as cultural colonialism than a benign settlement of the region. This act of migration was underpinned by a contradiction. Those involved were fleeing England&#8217;s cultural dominance while failing to grasp that they would pose the same threat to indigenous Patagonians. Some opponents feel that Wales&#8217; involvement in the region has escaped the criticism levelled at, for example, British expansion in places like India and Africa, because received wisdom has always portrayed the Welsh as colonised and disempowered. Finally, modern anthropological researchers have reported that there are no actual native Welsh speakers remaining in Patagonia. Claims about Welsh language speakers actually refer to second language speakers or language learners. Nevertheless, there are currently three bilingual Welsh-Spanish schools in Patagonia.</div><div><br></div><div>Whatever the point of view, there is no escaping the fact that there is now a small island of Wales in the centre of Argentinian Patagonia.</div>",

          "content": "<b>The Greatest Animal Migrations</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Massive animal migrations are among nature&#8217;s most inspiring events. Whether by wing, fin or hoof, the distance some creatures travel in search of a new habitat is paralleled only by what they endure to survive.</div><div><br></div><div><b>A The Leatherback Turtle</b></div><div>Most sea turtles migrate seasonally between foraging and nesting grounds in spring and summer. Often, these migrations take them hundreds and even thousands of miles. The leatherback turtle is the record holder, travelling an astounding ten thousand miles or more each year in search of jellyfish, crossing the entire Pacific Ocean from Asia to the West Coast of the US. Sea turtles nest in tropical and subtropical regions around the globe. Both males and females will migrate to nesting areas to breed, generally in the area where they were born. It is not known exactly how adult turtles are able to navigate to their birth beaches, however, researchers think they may use a number of clues such as the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field and water chemistry. Also, while research efforts on nesting beaches are ongoing, relatively little is known about how leatherbacks exploit oceanic pathways.</div><div><br></div><div><b>B The Dragonfly</b></div><div>Dragonflies are capable of long-distance migrations, but until recently, scientists had no idea how far they travelled. In 2009, scientists discovered an eight to fifteen thousand mile dragonfly migration route that spanned from India to the Maldives, the Seychelles, Mozambique, Uganda and back again. Incredibly, the epic migration spans four generations of dragonflies, with each generation playing its part in the journey much like a relay race. It is easily the longest insect migration ever discovered and migrating insects might be the foundation of an airborne ecosystem that wings its way north and south from year to year. The migratory patterns and apparent decision rules of dragonflies are strikingly similar to those proposed for songbirds, and may represent a general migration strategy for long-distance migration of organisms with high self-propelled flight speeds.</div><div><br></div><div><b>C The Wildebeest</b></div><div>Perhaps the most famous animal migration is the journey of Africa&#8217;s Serengeti wildebeest herds, which travel by the millions in search of greener pastures. The great Serengeti wildebeest migration is the movement of vast numbers of these Serengeti animals, accompanied by large numbers of zebra, and smaller numbers of Grant&#8217;s gazelle, Thompson&#8217;s gazelle, eland and impala. They migrate throughout the year, constantly seeking fresh grazing and, it&#8217;s now thought, better quality water. The precise timing of the Serengeti wildebeest migration is entirely dependent upon the rainfall patterns each year.</div><div><br></div><div><b>D The Caribou</b></div><div>North America&#8217;s caribou populations migrate the furthest of any terrestrial mammal, a journey that can span more than three thousand individuals in a group annually. As summer approaches, caribou herds head north in one of the world&#8217;s great large-animal migrations. They may travel more than nine hundred and sixty-five kilometers along well-trodden annual routes. At the end of their journey, they spend the summer feeding. In these rich grounds, an adult caribou can eat five kilograms of food each day. This is where they will breed. When the first snows falls each year, the caribou turn south and complete the migration cycle. They spend the winter in forested areas for easier foraging and survive by feeding on lichens. Caribou have large hooves that are useful tools for life in the harsh northlands. The hoof&#8217;s underside is hollowed out like a scoop and used for digging through the snow in search of food. Its sharp edges give the animal good grip on rocks or ice.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>E The Zambian Fruit Bat</b></div><div>Although only a few bat species are migratory, the ones that travel seasonally do so in spectacular fashion. In fact, the world&#8217;s largest air mammal migration is the annual journey of Zambia&#8217;s straw- colored fruit bats. An astounding eight million Zambian fruit bats blanket the air during the migration, as they travel to feed on their favorite delicacy, the musuku fruit. The concentration of the bats is very dense during the migration, with up to hundreds of bats per square metre. When they are busy clinging on tree branches, the snakes and crocodiles are always waiting to devour the unlucky bats which fall below the trees. Where bats live is dependent on the availability of food. When the food supply declines, bats have two options. They can hibernate to pass through the low or non-existent food supply period, or migrate to a place with a more abundant food supply. In some areas, bats will also do a combination of both.</div><div><br></div><div><b>F Baleen Whales</b></div><div>While many of the world&#8217;s species of marine mammals migrate, none go the distance like giant baleen whales. The gray whale, which travels as far as fourteen thousand miles round trip annually, and the humpback whale, which travels as far as sixteen thousand miles round trip annually, migrate a greater distance than any other mammal on Earth. Before they migrate, Baleen whales feed a lot in colder waters to store up enough food to make the trip and to compensate for the lack of prey in the warmer waters, where they migrate for the winter. As it&#8217;s warmer, they use less energy, and thus need less food to live. Without the pressures of feeding, baleen whales turn their attention to another matter: calving. Breeding and birthing takes place in the warmer waters, and baleen whale calves remain in the area with their mothers for a while, gaining strength and size for the colder waters.</div>",

          "content": "<b>The Sauna</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>Two thousand years ago, the itinerant Finns established a fur trade with Central Europe and gave up their wandering ways. As their numbers increased, they moved inland, turning to the soil for sustenance. Anthropologists know little about the Finns before the Middle Ages; therefore, the origin of the sauna is in question. Most researchers agree that Finns always had some form of sweat bath, as did most people around the world. It was one of the simplest and most efficient ways to satisfy people&#8217;s innate need to keep clean. When the Finns were nomadic, they probably used a sweat lodge they could take with them, similar to those carried by the American Indians and still seen among nomadic tribes in central Asia. The first sauna was dug into an embankment in the ground with plank sides. Later saunas were built above ground with wooden logs for the floor, walls and roof. Rocks were heated in a stone stove with a wood fire until the rocks were super hot. This room did not have a chimney, but a small air vent in the back wall. It was a half-day process to heat this type of room and when the sauna reached the required temperature, the bathers entered after the smoke cleared. The walls and ceiling would become dark black and so this original sauna was called &#8220;savu&#8221; (Finnish for smoke).</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>In the early 18th century, Scandinavian saunas lost their functional use in society and gathered opponents in Europe. The opponents of the sweat bath in Finland, Norway and Sweden were a coalition of economists, who maintained it wasted firewood. Their claims were not unfounded. People traditionally took a sauna every day, which consumed a considerable amount of firewood. Furthermore, the outside saunas rotted faster than other buildings, seldom lasting more than twelve years, and they were in need of constant renovation. This put pressure on family and community finances. Finns were under great duress from the Swedes to abandon the sauna. Propagandists warned against its harmful effects, claiming they caused illness, convulsions, tumors, premature loss of vision, and that they were particularly dangerous for children.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>The explosion of World War II halted this declining trend. Food became scarce, theaters and other forms of entertainment closed and life became bleak. Sauna was one of the few pastimes people could enjoy. The military also found the sauna essential. They used tents with special sauna heating units as means of delousing the soldiers and boosting morale. Often, a sauna left by an evacuated villager was repaired and heated by the freezing troops. After the war, the upward trend continued, helped by new companies creating better and cheaper to run saunas.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>In modern times, the benefits of the sauna are known around the world. Although sauna bathing can cause various acute, transient cardiovascular and hormonal changes, it is well tolerated by most healthy adults and children. Various studies have indicated that long-term sauna bathing may help lower blood pressure in patients with hypertension, provide relief to patients with asthma and chronic bronchitis and also alleviate pain and improve joint mobility in patients with rheumatic disease. The use of extreme cold interspersed with the heat of the sauna has long been a perceived benefit of the sauna. Today, rather than jumping into an ice cold lake after the sauna, people are more likely to use a plunge pool, and this process gently cools and cleanses the skin while closing the skin pores. The mental benefits of this ancient practice are still reported by many users. The warm and quiet environment stimulates circulation and the discharge of endorphins, creating a sense of peaceful relaxation and well-being. The endorphin discharge also aids the relaxation of muscles. As the body temperature rises, blood vessels dilate and circulation increases, which is thought to aid muscle repair. This has the effect of soothing aches and pains acquired from exercise, making use of the sauna perfect for post-sports recovery and the breakdown of lactic acid. The sweating process also helps to detoxify the body. Sweat contains many salts and metals, such as mercury, that are difficult for the body to dispose of.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>Finns used the sauna for rites of passage. Children were born in the sauna, women went through the purification ritual before marriage, and old people often dragged themselves there to die. Even today, many middle-aged Finns boast of being born in the sauna. Besides its social value, the sauna was the only place that was warm, germ-free and with plenty of water. The sauna&#8217;s smoke contained tannic acid that sterilised the surfaces of the sauna. The sauna was also used as an infirmary where blood cupping, blood letting and minor operations were performed by the barber, surgeon or village apothecary.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>Obviously, the traditional sauna, with its hundreds of kilos of rocks and logs, was not a marketable item. However, as innovations developed, saunas became cheaper to build, run and maintain. The vented, continuous wood-burning stove was manufactured for countryside saunas and, immediately after World War II, gas-heated stoves began heating city saunas. Later, electrical stoves came into use in most parts of Scandinavia, as it was more convenient to heat up the stones with electrical energy. This type of electrical heating is still used in many sauna houses of Scandinavia. Its use also curtailed the use of precious wood from the forest. High standards have helped the modern sauna&#8217;s popularity and the success of the sauna industry can be attributed to the Finnish Sauna Society, whose engineers and draftsmen have imposed stern standards on the sauna companies. Government legislation also helps the regulation of the implementation of sauna innovation.</div>",

Sometimes referred to simplistically as &#8216;people skills,&#8217; social intelligence includes people&#8217;s awareness of themselves and the social dynamics around them, and knowledge of the interaction styles and strategies that can help a person achieve his or her objectives in dealing with others. It also involves a certain amount of self-insight and a consciousness of one&#8217;s own perceptions and reaction patterns. The socially intelligent person knows how to play different roles, allowing him or her to feel comfortable with whoever is being interacted with. As a result, the socially intelligent individual feels self-confident and effective, what psychologists call &#8216;social self-efficacy.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div>From the standpoint of interpersonal skills, psychologists have classified behaviour towards others as falling somewhere on a spectrum between a &#8216;toxic&#8217; effect and a &#8216;nourishing&#8217; effect. Toxic behaviour makes people feel devalued, angry, frustrated, guilty or otherwise inadequate. Nourishing behaviour makes people feel valued, respected, affirmed, encouraged or competent. Continued patterns of toxic behaviour indicates a low level of social intelligence, which is the inability to connect with people and influence them effectively. Nourishing behaviour, on the other hand, tends to make a person much more effective in dealing with others.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The old idea that a person&#8217;s potential in life can be measured and predicted by a single number - his or her &#8216;IQ&#8217; score - has lost a great deal of credibility during the last decade or so. Many researchers now accept Professor Howard Gardner&#8217;s proposition that intelligence is multidimensional, and many believe that each of the key dimensions of intelligence can continue to increase throughout one&#8217;s life, given suitable opportunities. Social intelligence is one of these intelligences.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Social intelligence is often mixed up with emotional intelligence and some psychologists have included social intelligence as part of Gardner&#8217;s emotional intelligence. In practical terms, however, it makes more sense to think of emotional intelligence and social intelligence as two discrete competences. Social intelligence is separate from, but complimentary to emotional intelligence, and Gardner himself differentiates them by referring to them as interpersonal intelligence (social) and intrapersonal intelligence (emotional). People need both models in order to understand themselves and the way they interact with others. This is not to say that these two intelligences are mutually exclusive. Some deficits in social intelligence arise from inadequate development of emotional intelligence; conversely, some deficits in social intelligence may lead to unsuccessful social experiences. These shortcomings may undermine a person&#8217;s self-worth, which is part of emotional intelligence.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In the simplest terms, social intelligence is to have effective relationships with people, which most people generally learn as they grow up, mature, and gain experience in dealing with others. Unfortunately, many people do not continue to learn and develop these skills as they age, and many people never acquire the awareness and skills they need to succeed in social, business or professional situations. As social intelligence is highly valued in business environments, there have therefore been many efforts to teach it. By first understanding social intelligence as a combination of skills expressed through learned behavior, and then assessing the impact of one&#8217;s behaviour on others &#8211; i.e. the degree to which one is successful in dealing with others &#8211; people can learn to experiment with new behaviours and new interaction strategies. It is quite clear that adults who are deficient in insight and competence in dealing with others can make significant improvements in their social intelligence status as a result of understanding the basic concepts, but they need to be able to assess themselves continually against a comprehensive model of interpersonal effectiveness.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Measuring social intelligence was once thought to be impossible, but psychologists have developed a number of ways of doing so. The social intelligence quotient is a statistical abstraction, similar to the standard score approach used in IQ tests, with a mean of 100. Scores of 140 or above are considered to be very high. Unlike the standard IQ test, it is not a fixed model. It leans more to the point of view that intelligence is not a fixed attribute, but a complex hierarchy of information-processing skills underlying an adaptive equilibrium between the individual and the environment. Therefore, an individual can change their social intelligence quotient by altering their attitudes and behaviour in response to their complex social environment. People with a low social intelligence quotient are more suited to work with low customer contact, as well as in smaller groups or teams, or independently, because they may not have the required interpersonal communication and social skills for success with customers and other co-workers. People with a social intelligence quotient over 120 are considered socially skilled, and may work exceptionally well with jobs that involve direct contact and communication with other people.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Today&#8217;s society, especially in a school context, has always put much more significant emphasis on traditional proofs of intelligence, such as IQ and doing well at school and college, than social intelligence, and this does not look set to change. However, most people&#8217;s lives are much more affected by their social interactions. People&#8217;s relationships partners, friends, colleagues and children all significantly enhance people&#8217;s well-being and everyday happiness. If people invested more in their social intelligence skills then they could find themselves in a life with which they were much more satisfied.<br></div>",

Breaking waves move sand along the coast, eroding sand in one area and depositing it on an adjacent beach. Tidal cycles bring sand onto the beach and carry it back into the surf. Rivers carry sediment to the coast and build deltas in the open water. Storms cause deep erosion in rock cliffs and leave thick overwash deposits in other coastal areas. Plants retain sediment in wetlands and impede movement of coastal dunes. Taken individually, each natural process of coastal transport is complex; taken collectively, they create an extraordinarily intricate system that attempts to achieve a natural balance.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>While the same dynamic processes cause continuous change on every coast, coasts do not all respond in the same way. Interactions among the different processes and the degree to which a particular process controls change depend upon localised factors. They include the coast&#8217;s proximity to sediment-laden rivers and tectonic activity, the topography and composition of the land, the prevailing wind and weather patterns, and the configuration of the coastline and nearshore geometry. Earthscience research is showing that these surroundings determine not only the changes to the coast, but also the type of coast produced.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>People&#8217;s activities add another layer of complexity to the natural processes of coastal lands and materials, and these activities may have direct or indirect effects on our changing coasts. They may affect sources of new sediment taken to the coast and the movement of sediment within the coastal environment, and they may promote changes in sea level, both local and global. People&#8217;s activities are often conducted without an adequate understanding of coastal geology and processes, and, as a result, they can lead to unforeseen degradation of coasts. Even people&#8217;s actions intended to save or improve the coast may inadvertently increase erosion. Cooperative investigations are starting to provide the crucial information needed to minimise the unintended effects of people&#8217;s disturbances along coasts.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>As the number of active landfills dwindles and coastal populations grow, offshore waste dumping and coastal contamination increase. This additional dumping also increases the amount of improper waste disposal affecting the coastal environment and water quality. Living coral reefs are particularly vulnerable, but other coastal environments suffer as well. Medical waste, including used hypodermic needles, was washed onto the New Jersey and New York beaches during the summer of 1988, resulting in an economic disaster for the recreation industries in the region. Fishing industries have also been severely damaged by this and more than one-third of U.S. shellfish beds are closed or restricted as a result of contamination.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>The southeastern coast, rimmed by a series of shorelines on obstructive islands and spits, separates the mainland coastal plain from a wide, gently sloping offshore continental shelf. This generally tectonically stable region has a hurricane season during the late summer to winter months. Most rivers cutting through the low-lying coastal plain flow slowly to the sea and deposit their sand-sized sediment in bays and estuaries before reaching the coast. The river&#8217;s suspended load of finer particles settles out in the sounds and bays that are protected by the obstructive islands and spits. The major source of new sediment to these beaches of the southeastern United States is from the erosion of adjacent headlands and beaches, whose sand generally migrates south as a result of longshore transport. Sand transported landward from the continental shelf may also contribute to the coast and nearshore sand budget.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>Dune erosion occurs when storm surge elevates waves higher on the beach, allowing them to attack and erode coastal dunes. As sand is removed from a dune, the front face becomes very steep, or scarped. The overall volume and elevation of the dune is reduced due to the erosion process. Dune erosion threatens houses behind the dunes as the area becomes significantly more vulnerable to future storms and the potential for overwash, which is when storm-induced waves exceed the height of the dune and transport sand over the top of the dune and deposit it inland. Depending on the severity of the storm, the overwash can extend several hundred metres. The eroded sediment from the dune is carried offshore and stored in large sandbars. The sand dune can recover over a period of years, gaining in elevation and volume through deposits of wind-blown sand. However, because dunes rebuild over a long period, many coastal counties choose to build temporary dunes following a large storm.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>One specific way that coasts are altered is through longshore drifting, which is mainly seen with sand beaches, although clay, silt and shingle beaches are also affected. The sand on beaches is largely supplied over time by rivers flowing into the sea. Longshore drifting is then responsible for moving this sand along the coast line. It is caused when waves approach a beach at a slight angle. After the wave has broken on the beach, the swash runs back downslope perpendicular to the shoreline. This results in sand removal downdrift from the beach. Sand is therefore transported predominantly in one direction and the beach eventually ceases to exist.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Science of Online Dating</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>As the saying goes, &#8220;love defies all calculation&#8221;. Yet, this apparently obvious assertion is challenged by the intrusion of science into matters of love, including the application of scientific analysis to modern forms of courtship. An increasing number of dating services boast about their use of biological research and genetic testing to better match prospective partners. Yet, while research continues to disentangle the complex factors that make humans fall in love, the application of this research remains dubious.<br></div><div><br></div><div>With the rise of the Internet and profound changes in contemporary lifestyles, online dating has gained enormous popularity among people of all ages. Dating website owner Don Walker explains. &#8220;Increased working hours, increasing mobility and the dissolution of traditional modes of socialisation mean that more and more people are using chat rooms and professional dating services to find partners.&#8221; Notwithstanding the current downturn in the economy, the online dating industry continues to prosper. With subscription prices between 20 and 30 dollars per month, romance-seekers are turning away from the traditional and often expensive strategies of meeting people, and are instead opting for less spontaneous, but practical, cheap online services that allow them to find a soul mate from the comfort of a desk.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Most dating services match subscribers based on metrics that include education and professional background, personal interests, hobbies, values, relationship skills and life goals. These websites use a range of personality tests to collate the traits that individuals seek in an ideal partner. Yet, in this modern era of personalised genomes and DNA-based crime fighting, the new generation of online dating services has added one more parameter: biology. Indeed, biological anthropologists and neuroscientists have already dissected some of the chemical ingredients of love, including the security that we experience when we are attached to a specific partner for the long term. Such studies aim to unravel both the genetic factors and the neural circuits that underlie love. Researcher Amanda Torres gives the progress. &#8220;We have found that the relevant regions of the brain are mainly those involved in motivational and reward systems and are orchestrated by hormones and neurotransmitters. Love can accordingly be described as a chemical phenomenon and we can compare it with a state of physical dependence.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Helen Mills, professor of anthropology at a respected Australian University, has created a test for a popular online dating website in which questions are designed to establish a range of basic information about brain and body chemistry associated with specific aspects of temperament and personality. For instance, measuring the ratio between the length of the index finger and the ring finger of the right hand is a possible marker for testosterone, and eye measurements can provide information about assertive, verbal, musical or analytical capabilities. Other questions, supposedly based on dopamine levels in the brain, can determine a propensity to be curious or a tendency to seek novel experiences. Mills justifies her rationale. &#8220;We fall in love with someone who has a chemical profile that complements our own. Therefore a good knowledge of an individual&#8217;s chemistry can be a significant factor in finding the right person for them.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>The customers of online dating services seem to buy the &#8216;hard science&#8217; sell. &#8220;We are receiving requests from a lot of customers who wish to know whether they can test their genetic compatibility with other subscribers in the same area where they live,&#8221; commented Linda Brown, chief scientific officer at another popular dating website. &#8220;Right now, the number of established couples willing to know whether their compatibility is confirmed genetically equals the number of singles who ask us to match them with other subscribers in our database.&#8221; Brown emphasised that the company uses biological compatibility to complement social, psychological and intellectual information, which, she said, &#8220;will continue to play an important role in the formation of lasting relationships.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>The use of genetic information seems to give customers reassurance that they will find a better match. Nevertheless, the real question remains as to whether the use of genetics is proving more effective than traditional matching methods. Indeed, there is a good deal of skepticism concerning the reliability of DNA-based dating services. Courtship and romantic love are complex phenomena that involve many genes and a multitude of social and cultural factors. Deciphering the genetics and neurochemistry of love might, therefore, cast a disenchanting shadow over some cultural practices. Jim Young, a U.S.-based psychologist gives his opinion. &#8220;I think that matching people by personality types or interests may be very useful. However, any service that claims to use genetic information, or any estimation of neurochemistry based on personality or genotype does not have any basis in reality.&#8221; Young, who investigates the genetics and molecular mechanisms behind social attachment, also points out that &#8220;although we might be beginning to understand how some genes contribute to social relationships, the situation is far too complex to begin to think we can pick &#8216;the perfect match&#8217; based on this information. Internet dating websites that claim they can do this exploit a gullible public who have been educated by the media.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>In addition to the potentially disenchanting effect of using science to prescribe romance, emotional compatibility and loving relationships, the increasing tendency to apply genetics to multiple areas of social interaction and behaviour raises more general issues about the growing encroachment of genetics and neuroscience into personal lives. Haunted by the uncertainties of life, humans are drawn to any service or person that promises to foretell the future. Perhaps it was therefore only a matter of time before biology became entangled in attempting to predict the creation of love and the outcome of relationships.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>Social Intelligence</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>Social intelligence is the ability to get along well with others, and to get them to cooperate with you. Sometimes referred to simplistically as &#8216;people skills,&#8217; social intelligence includes people&#8217;s awareness of themselves and the social dynamics around them, and knowledge of the interaction styles and strategies that can help a person achieve his or her objectives in dealing with others. It also involves a certain amount of self-insight and a consciousness of one&#8217;s own perceptions and reaction patterns. The socially intelligent person knows how to play different roles, allowing him or her to feel comfortable with whoever is being interacted with. As a result, the socially intelligent individual feels self-confident and effective, what psychologists call &#8216;social self-efficacy.&#8217;<br></div><div><br></div><div>From the standpoint of interpersonal skills, psychologists have classified behaviour towards others as falling somewhere on a spectrum between a &#8216;toxic&#8217; effect and a &#8216;nourishing&#8217; effect. Toxic behaviour makes people feel devalued, angry, frustrated, guilty or otherwise inadequate. Nourishing behaviour makes people feel valued, respected, affirmed, encouraged or competent. Continued patterns of toxic behaviour indicates a low level of social intelligence, which is the inability to connect with people and influence them effectively. Nourishing behaviour, on the other hand, tends to make a person much more effective in dealing with others.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The old idea that a person&#8217;s potential in life can be measured and predicted by a single number - his or her &#8216;IQ&#8217; score - has lost a great deal of credibility during the last decade or so. Many researchers now accept Professor Howard Gardner&#8217;s proposition that intelligence is multidimensional, and many believe that each of the key dimensions of intelligence can continue to increase throughout one&#8217;s life, given suitable opportunities. Social intelligence is one of these intelligences.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Social intelligence is often mixed up with emotional intelligence and some psychologists have included social intelligence as part of Gardner&#8217;s emotional intelligence. In practical terms, however, it makes more sense to think of emotional intelligence and social intelligence as two discrete competences. Social intelligence is separate from, but complimentary to emotional intelligence, and Gardner himself differentiates them by referring to them as interpersonal intelligence (social) and intrapersonal intelligence (emotional). People need both models in order to understand themselves and the way they interact with others. This is not to say that these two intelligences are mutually exclusive. Some deficits in social intelligence arise from inadequate development of emotional intelligence; conversely, some deficits in social intelligence may lead to unsuccessful social experiences. These shortcomings may undermine a person&#8217;s self-worth, which is part of emotional intelligence.<br></div><div><br></div><div>In the simplest terms, social intelligence is to have effective relationships with people, which most people generally learn as they grow up, mature, and gain experience in dealing with others. Unfortunately, many people do not continue to learn and develop these skills as they age, and many people never acquire the awareness and skills they need to succeed in social, business or professional situations. As social intelligence is highly valued in business environments, there have therefore been many efforts to teach it. By first understanding social intelligence as a combination of skills expressed through learned behavior, and then assessing the impact of one&#8217;s behaviour on others &#8211; i.e. the degree to which one is successful in dealing with others &#8211; people can learn to experiment with new behaviours and new interaction strategies. It is quite clear that adults who are deficient in insight and competence in dealing with others can make significant improvements in their social intelligence status as a result of understanding the basic concepts, but they need to be able to assess themselves continually against a comprehensive model of interpersonal effectiveness.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Measuring social intelligence was once thought to be impossible, but psychologists have developed a number of ways of doing so. The social intelligence quotient is a statistical abstraction, similar to the standard score approach used in IQ tests, with a mean of 100. Scores of 140 or above are considered to be very high. Unlike the standard IQ test, it is not a fixed model. It leans more to the point of view that intelligence is not a fixed attribute, but a complex hierarchy of information-processing skills underlying an adaptive equilibrium between the individual and the environment. Therefore, an individual can change their social intelligence quotient by altering their attitudes and behaviour in response to their complex social environment. People with a low social intelligence quotient are more suited to work with low customer contact, as well as in smaller groups or teams, or independently, because they may not have the required interpersonal communication and social skills for success with customers and other co-workers. People with a social intelligence quotient over 120 are considered socially skilled, and may work exceptionally well with jobs that involve direct contact and communication with other people.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Today&#8217;s society, especially in a school context, has always put much more significant emphasis on traditional proofs of intelligence, such as IQ and doing well at school and college, than social intelligence, and this does not look set to change. However, most people&#8217;s lives are much more affected by their social interactions. People&#8217;s relationships partners, friends, colleagues and children all significantly enhance people&#8217;s well-being and everyday happiness. If people invested more in their social intelligence skills then they could find themselves in a life with which they were much more satisfied.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>U.S. Coastal Change</b><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Paragraph A</b></div><div>U.S. coastal lands and sediments are constantly in motion. Breaking waves move sand along the coast, eroding sand in one area and depositing it on an adjacent beach. Tidal cycles bring sand onto the beach and carry it back into the surf. Rivers carry sediment to the coast and build deltas in the open water. Storms cause deep erosion in rock cliffs and leave thick overwash deposits in other coastal areas. Plants retain sediment in wetlands and impede movement of coastal dunes. Taken individually, each natural process of coastal transport is complex; taken collectively, they create an extraordinarily intricate system that attempts to achieve a natural balance.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph B</b></div><div>While the same dynamic processes cause continuous change on every coast, coasts do not all respond in the same way. Interactions among the different processes and the degree to which a particular process controls change depend upon localised factors. They include the coast&#8217;s proximity to sediment-laden rivers and tectonic activity, the topography and composition of the land, the prevailing wind and weather patterns, and the configuration of the coastline and nearshore geometry. Earthscience research is showing that these surroundings determine not only the changes to the coast, but also the type of coast produced.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph C</b></div><div>People&#8217;s activities add another layer of complexity to the natural processes of coastal lands and materials, and these activities may have direct or indirect effects on our changing coasts. They may affect sources of new sediment taken to the coast and the movement of sediment within the coastal environment, and they may promote changes in sea level, both local and global. People&#8217;s activities are often conducted without an adequate understanding of coastal geology and processes, and, as a result, they can lead to unforeseen degradation of coasts. Even people&#8217;s actions intended to save or improve the coast may inadvertently increase erosion. Cooperative investigations are starting to provide the crucial information needed to minimise the unintended effects of people&#8217;s disturbances along coasts.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph D</b></div><div>As the number of active landfills dwindles and coastal populations grow, offshore waste dumping and coastal contamination increase. This additional dumping also increases the amount of improper waste disposal affecting the coastal environment and water quality. Living coral reefs are particularly vulnerable, but other coastal environments suffer as well. Medical waste, including used hypodermic needles, was washed onto the New Jersey and New York beaches during the summer of 1988, resulting in an economic disaster for the recreation industries in the region. Fishing industries have also been severely damaged by this and more than one-third of U.S. shellfish beds are closed or restricted as a result of contamination.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph E</b></div><div>The southeastern coast, rimmed by a series of shorelines on obstructive islands and spits, separates the mainland coastal plain from a wide, gently sloping offshore continental shelf. This generally tectonically stable region has a hurricane season during the late summer to winter months. Most rivers cutting through the low-lying coastal plain flow slowly to the sea and deposit their sand-sized sediment in bays and estuaries before reaching the coast. The river&#8217;s suspended load of finer particles settles out in the sounds and bays that are protected by the obstructive islands and spits. The major source of new sediment to these beaches of the southeastern United States is from the erosion of adjacent headlands and beaches, whose sand generally migrates south as a result of longshore transport. Sand transported landward from the continental shelf may also contribute to the coast and nearshore sand budget.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph F</b></div><div>Dune erosion occurs when storm surge elevates waves higher on the beach, allowing them to attack and erode coastal dunes. As sand is removed from a dune, the front face becomes very steep, or scarped. The overall volume and elevation of the dune is reduced due to the erosion process. Dune erosion threatens houses behind the dunes as the area becomes significantly more vulnerable to future storms and the potential for overwash, which is when storm-induced waves exceed the height of the dune and transport sand over the top of the dune and deposit it inland. Depending on the severity of the storm, the overwash can extend several hundred metres. The eroded sediment from the dune is carried offshore and stored in large sandbars. The sand dune can recover over a period of years, gaining in elevation and volume through deposits of wind-blown sand. However, because dunes rebuild over a long period, many coastal counties choose to build temporary dunes following a large storm.<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Paragraph G</b></div><div>One specific way that coasts are altered is through longshore drifting, which is mainly seen with sand beaches, although clay, silt and shingle beaches are also affected. The sand on beaches is largely supplied over time by rivers flowing into the sea. Longshore drifting is then responsible for moving this sand along the coast line. It is caused when waves approach a beach at a slight angle. After the wave has broken on the beach, the swash runs back downslope perpendicular to the shoreline. This results in sand removal downdrift from the beach. Sand is therefore transported predominantly in one direction and the beach eventually ceases to exist.<br></div>",

          "content": "<b>The Science of Online Dating</b><div><b><br></b></div><div>As the saying goes, &#8220;love defies all calculation&#8221;. Yet, this apparently obvious assertion is challenged by the intrusion of science into matters of love, including the application of scientific analysis to modern forms of courtship. An increasing number of dating services boast about their use of biological research and genetic testing to better match prospective partners. Yet, while research continues to disentangle the complex factors that make humans fall in love, the application of this research remains dubious.<br></div><div><br></div><div>With the rise of the Internet and profound changes in contemporary lifestyles, online dating has gained enormous popularity among people of all ages. Dating website owner Don Walker explains. &#8220;Increased working hours, increasing mobility and the dissolution of traditional modes of socialisation mean that more and more people are using chat rooms and professional dating services to find partners.&#8221; Notwithstanding the current downturn in the economy, the online dating industry continues to prosper. With subscription prices between 20 and 30 dollars per month, romance-seekers are turning away from the traditional and often expensive strategies of meeting people, and are instead opting for less spontaneous, but practical, cheap online services that allow them to find a soul mate from the comfort of a desk.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Most dating services match subscribers based on metrics that include education and professional background, personal interests, hobbies, values, relationship skills and life goals. These websites use a range of personality tests to collate the traits that individuals seek in an ideal partner. Yet, in this modern era of personalised genomes and DNA-based crime fighting, the new generation of online dating services has added one more parameter: biology. Indeed, biological anthropologists and neuroscientists have already dissected some of the chemical ingredients of love, including the security that we experience when we are attached to a specific partner for the long term. Such studies aim to unravel both the genetic factors and the neural circuits that underlie love. Researcher Amanda Torres gives the progress. &#8220;We have found that the relevant regions of the brain are mainly those involved in motivational and reward systems and are orchestrated by hormones and neurotransmitters. Love can accordingly be described as a chemical phenomenon and we can compare it with a state of physical dependence.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>Helen Mills, professor of anthropology at a respected Australian University, has created a test for a popular online dating website in which questions are designed to establish a range of basic information about brain and body chemistry associated with specific aspects of temperament and personality. For instance, measuring the ratio between the length of the index finger and the ring finger of the right hand is a possible marker for testosterone, and eye measurements can provide information about assertive, verbal, musical or analytical capabilities. Other questions, supposedly based on dopamine levels in the brain, can determine a propensity to be curious or a tendency to seek novel experiences. Mills justifies her rationale. &#8220;We fall in love with someone who has a chemical profile that complements our own. Therefore a good knowledge of an individual&#8217;s chemistry can be a significant factor in finding the right person for them.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>The customers of online dating services seem to buy the &#8216;hard science&#8217; sell. &#8220;We are receiving requests from a lot of customers who wish to know whether they can test their genetic compatibility with other subscribers in the same area where they live,&#8221; commented Linda Brown, chief scientific officer at another popular dating website. &#8220;Right now, the number of established couples willing to know whether their compatibility is confirmed genetically equals the number of singles who ask us to match them with other subscribers in our database.&#8221; Brown emphasised that the company uses biological compatibility to complement social, psychological and intellectual information, which, she said, &#8220;will continue to play an important role in the formation of lasting relationships.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>The use of genetic information seems to give customers reassurance that they will find a better match. Nevertheless, the real question remains as to whether the use of genetics is proving more effective than traditional matching methods. Indeed, there is a good deal of skepticism concerning the reliability of DNA-based dating services. Courtship and romantic love are complex phenomena that involve many genes and a multitude of social and cultural factors. Deciphering the genetics and neurochemistry of love might, therefore, cast a disenchanting shadow over some cultural practices. Jim Young, a U.S.-based psychologist gives his opinion. &#8220;I think that matching people by personality types or interests may be very useful. However, any service that claims to use genetic information, or any estimation of neurochemistry based on personality or genotype does not have any basis in reality.&#8221; Young, who investigates the genetics and molecular mechanisms behind social attachment, also points out that &#8220;although we might be beginning to understand how some genes contribute to social relationships, the situation is far too complex to begin to think we can pick &#8216;the perfect match&#8217; based on this information. Internet dating websites that claim they can do this exploit a gullible public who have been educated by the media.&#8221;<br></div><div><br></div><div>In addition to the potentially disenchanting effect of using science to prescribe romance, emotional compatibility and loving relationships, the increasing tendency to apply genetics to multiple areas of social interaction and behaviour raises more general issues about the growing encroachment of genetics and neuroscience into personal lives. Haunted by the uncertainties of life, humans are drawn to any service or person that promises to foretell the future. Perhaps it was therefore only a matter of time before biology became entangled in attempting to predict the creation of love and the outcome of relationships.<br></div>",

First, artificial interlligence, computers and robot help learners can learn by them self and learn everywhere, while before artificial interlligence develop, some students has to need teachers to help them. For example, when university students have face the problem in homework and not know how to solve the problem in home, they can ask the questions for AI to help them, while need the support from the teachers. Second, artificial interlligence, computers and robot also help student reduce time-consuming by the ways help them deviced the task logically. For instance, when learners have a lot of task to do in the short time, robot such at AI would help them deviced the task to easy to focus the main task and solve the tasks faster.</span></div><div><span>On the other hand, the roles of teachers is important for students, including always support students better and can do the thing what robot cannot do. First, teachers can support students whenever they need and can do everything to help students better. For example, when students have problme but cannot talk with each other, teachers can be the person that students can talk and they would take secreat for students, while sometime robots such as AI have problem causes to leak the students's information. Second, teachers can do more things that artificial interlligence cannot do, this is because teacher have love for students but robot are not. For instance, teachers can teach children how to mature better than the robot, they can find the best ways to help students develop better in their study, job or in the furture.</span></div><div><span>Although the increases of artificial interlligence, computers and robot are good thing, the roles of teachers for students is very nessary. This is because teachers can do many thing for students than the artificial interlligence, including s</span><span>upport students better and can do the thing what robot cannot do. However, to make the develope of artificial interlligence, computers and robot will not take over the roles of teachers, students shoud have the interlligence choosing the source of support and balances between the roles of artificial intelligence and teachers.&#160;</span></div>",

Until the late 18th century, it only grew in one place in the world: a small group of islands in the Banda Sea, part of the Moluccas &#8211; or Spice Islands &#8211; in northeastern Indonesia. The tree is thickly branched with dense foliage of tough, dark green oval leaves, and produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers and pale yellow pear-shaped fruits. The fruit is encased in a fleshy husk. When the fruit is ripe, this husk splits into two halves along a ridge running the length of the fruit. Inside is a purple-brown shiny seed, 2&#8211;3 cm long by about 2 cm across, surrounded by a lacy red or crimson covering called an aril. These are the sources of the two spices nutmeg and mace, the former being produced from the dried seed and the latter from the rail.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Nutmeg was a highly prized and costly ingredient in European cuisine in the Middle Ages, and was used as a flavouring, medicinal, and preservative agent. Throughout this period, the Arabs were the exclusive importers of the spice to Europe. They sold nutmeg for high prices to merchants based in Venice, but they never revealed the exact location of the source of this extremely valuable commodity. The Arab-Venetian dominance of the trade finally ended in 1512, when the Portuguese reached the Banda Islands and began exploiting its precious resources.&#160;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Always in danger of competition from neighbouring Spain, the Portuguese began subcontracting their spice distribution to Dutch traders. Profits began to flow into the Netherlands, and the Dutch commercial fleet swiftly grew into one of the largest in the world. The Dutch quietly gained control of most of the shipping and trading of spices in Northern Europe. Then, in 1580, Portugal fell under Spanish rule, and by the end of the 16th century the Dutch found themselves locked out of the market. As prices for pepper, nutmeg, and other spices soared across Europe, they decided to fight back.prices for pepper, nutmeg, and other spices soared across Europe, they decided to fight back.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160; In 1602, Dutch merchants founded the VOC, a trading corporation better known as the Dutch East India Company. By 1617, the VOC was the richest commercial operation in the world. The company had 50,000 employees worldwide, with a private army of 30,000 men and a fleet of 200 ships. At the same time, thousands of people across Europe were dying of the plague, a highly contagious and deadly disease. Doctors were desperate for a way to stop the spread of this disease, and they decided nutmeg held the cure. Everybody wanted nutmeg, and many were willing to spare no expense to have it. Nutmeg bought for a few pennies in Indonesia could be sold for 68,000 times its original cost on the streets of London. The only problem was the short supply. And that&#8217;s where the Dutch found their opportunity.&#160;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;The Banda Islands were ruled by local sultans who insisted on maintaining a neutral trading policy towards foreign powers. This allowed them to avoid the presence of Portuguese or Spanish troops on their soil, but it also left them unprotected from other invaders. In 1621, the Dutch arrived and took over. Once securely in control of the Bandas, the Dutch went to work protecting their new investment. They concentrated all nutmeg production into a few easily guarded areas, uprooting and destroying any trees outside the plantation zones. Anyone caught growing a nutmeg seedling or carrying seeds without the proper authority was severely punished. In addition, all exported nutmeg was covered with lime to make sure there was no chance a fertile seed which could be grown elsewhere would leave the islands. There was only one obstacle to Dutch domination. One of the Banda Islands, a sliver of land called Run, only 3 km long by less than 1 km wide, was under the control of the British. After decades of fighting for control of this tiny island, the Dutch and British arrived at a compromise settlement, the Treaty of Breda, in 1667. Intent on securing their hold over every nutmeg-producing island, the Dutch offered a trade: if the British would give them the island of Run, they would in turn give Britain a distant and much less valuable island in North America. The British agreed. That other island was Manhattan, which is how New Amsterdam became New York. The Dutch now had a monopoly over the nutmeg trade which would last for another century.&#160;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Then, in 1770, a Frenchman named Pierre Poivre successfully smuggled nutmeg plants to safety in Mauritius, an island off the coast of Africa. Some of these were later exported to the Caribbean where they thrived, especially on the island of Grenada. Next, in 1778, a volcanic eruption in the Banda region caused a tsunami that wiped out half the nutmeg groves. Finally, in 1809, the British returned to Indonesia and seized the Banda Islands by force. They returned the islands to the Dutch in 1817, but not before transplanting hundreds of nutmeg seedlings to plantations in several locations across southern Asia. The Dutch nutmeg monopoly was over.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Today, nutmeg is grown in Indonesia, the Caribbean, India, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea and Sri Lanka, and world nutmeg production is estimated to average between 10,000 and 12,000 tonnes per year.</span><br></div>",

The automotive sector is well used to adapting to automation in manufacturing. The implementation of robotic car manufacture from the 1970s onwards led to significant cost savings and improvements in the reliability and flexibility of vehicle mass production. A new challenge to vehicle production is now on the horizon and, again, it comes from automation. However, this time it is not to do with the manufacturing process, but with the vehicles themselves.</font></span><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Research projects on vehicle automation are not new. Vehicles with limited self&#173; driving capabilities have been around for more than 50 years, resulting in significant contributions towards driver assistance systems. But since Google announced in 2010 that it had been trialling self-driving cars on the streets of California, progress in this field has quickly gathered pace.</font><br><p></p><div><span><br></span></div><div><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>B</b>.&#160;</font><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">There are many reasons why technology is advancing so fast. One frequently cited motive is safety; indeed, research at the UK's Transport Research Laboratory has demonstrated that more than 90 percent of road collisions involve human error as a contributory factor, and it is the primary cause in the vast majority. Automation may help to reduce the incidence of this.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Another aim is to free the time people spend driving for other purposes. If the vehicle can do some or all of the driving, it may be possible to be productive, to socialise or simply to relax while automation systems have responsibility for safe control of the vehicle. If the vehicle can do the driving, those who are challenged by existing mobility models - such as older or disabled travellers - may be able to enjoy significantly greater travel autonomy.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>C</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Beyond these direct benefits, we can consider the wider implications for transport and society, and how manufacturing processes might need to respond as a result. At present, the average car spends more than 90 percent of its life parked. Automation means that initiatives for car-sharing become much more viable, particularly in urban areas with significant travel demand. If a significant proportion of the population chooses to use shared automated vehicles, mobility demand can be met by far fewer vehicles.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>D</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">The Massachusetts Institute of Technology investigated automated mobility in Singapore, finding that fewer than 30 percent of the vehicles currently used would be required if fully automated car sharing could be implemented. If this is the case, it might mean that we need to manufacture far fewer vehicles to meet demand.</font></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>However, the number of trips being taken would probably increase, partly because empty vehicles would have to be moved from one customer to the next.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Modelling work by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute suggests automated vehicles might reduce vehicle ownership by 43 percent, but that vehicles' average annual mileage would double as a result. As a consequence, each vehicle would be used more intensively, and might need replacing sooner. This faster rate of turnover may mean that vehicle production will not necessarily decrease.</span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>E</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Automation may prompt other changes in vehicle manufacture. If we move to a model where consumers are tending not to own a single vehicle but to purchase access to a range of vehicles through a mobility provider, drivers will have the freedom to select one that best suits their needs for a particular journey, rather than making a compromise across all their requirements.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">Since, for most of the time, most of the seats in most cars are unoccupied, this may boost production of a smaller, more efficient range of vehicles that suit the needs of individuals. Specialised vehicles may then be available for exceptional journeys, such as going on a family camping trip or helping a son or daughter move to university.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>F</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">There are a number of hurdles to overcome in delivering automated vehicles to our roads. These include the technical difficulties in ensuring that the vehicle works reliably in the infinite range of traffic, weather and road situations it might encounter; the regulatory challenges in understanding how liability and enforcement might change when drivers are no longer essential for vehicle operation; and the societal changes that may be required for communities to trust and accept automated vehicles as being a valuable part of the mobility landscape.</font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><br></font></span></div><div><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\"><b>G</b>.&#160;</font></span><span><font face=\"Arial\" size=\"2\">It's clear that there are many challenges that need to be addressed but, through robust and targeted research, these can most probably be conquered within the next 10 years. Mobility will change in such potentially significant ways and in association with so many other technological developments, such as telepresence and virtual reality, that it is hard to make concrete predictions about the future. However, one thing is certain: change is coming, and the need to be flexible in response to this will be vital for those involved in manufacturing the vehicles that will deliver future mobility.</font></span></div></span></div>",

          "content": "<b>READING PASSAGE 3 </b><br>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading Passage 3 below.<br><div><span><b>WHAT IS EXPLORATION?</b><br><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;We are all explorers. Our desire to discover, and then share that new-found knowledge, is part of what makes us human - indeed, this has played an important part in our success as a species. Long before the first caveman slumped down beside the fire and grunted news that there were plenty of wildebeest over yonder, our ancestors had learnt the value of sending out scouts to investigate the unknown. This questing nature of ours undoubtedly helped our species spread around the globe, just as it nowadays no doubt helps the last nomadic Penan maintain their existence in the depleted forests of Borneo, and a visitor negotiate the subways of New York.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Over the years, we've come to think of explorers as a peculiar breed - different from the rest of us, different from those of us who are merely 'well travelled' , even; and perhaps there is a type of person more suited to seeking out the new, a type of caveman more inclined to risk venturing out. That, however, doesn't take away from the fact that we all have this enquiring instinct, even today; and that in all sorts of professions - whether artist, marine biologist or astronomer - borders of the unknown are being tested each day.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Thomas Hardy set some of his novels in Egdon Heath, a fictional area of uncultivated land, and used the landscape to suggest the desires and fears of his characters. He is delving into matters we all recognise because they are common to humanity. This is surely an act of exploration, and into a world as remote as the author chooses. Explorer and travel writer Peter Fleming talks of the moment when the explorer returns to the existence he has left behind with his loved ones. The traveller 'who has for weeks or months seen himself only as a puny and irrelevant alien crawling laboriously over a country in which he has no roots and no background, suddenly encounters his other self, a relatively solid figure, with a place in the minds of certain people'.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;In this book about the exploration of the earth's surface, I have confined myself to those whose travels were real and who also aimed at more than personal discovery. But that still left me with another problem: the word 'explorer' has become associated with a past era. We think back to a golden age, as if exploration peaked somehow in the 19th century - as if the process of discovery is now on the decline, though the truth is that we have named only one and a half million of this planet's species, and there may be more than 10 million - and that's not including bacteria. We have studied only 5 per cent of the species we know. We have scarcely mapped the ocean floors, and know even less about ourselves; we fully understand the workings of only 10 percent of our brains.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Here is how some of today's 'explorers' define the word. Ran Fiennes, dubbed the 'greatest living explorer', said, 'An explorer is someone who has done something that no human has done before - and also done something scientifically useful.' Chris Bonington, a leading mountaineer, felt exploration was to be found in the act of physically touching the unknown: 'You have to have gone somewhere new.' Then Robin Hanbury-Tenison, a campaigner on behalf of remote so-called 'tribal' peoples, said, 'A traveller simply records information about some far-off world, and reports back; but an explorer changes the world.' Wilfred Thesiger, who crossed Arabia's Empty Quarter in 1946, and belongs to an era of unmechanised travel now lost to the rest of us, told me, 'lf I'd gone across by camel when I could have gone by car, it would have been a stunt.' To him, exploration meant bringing back information from a remote place regardless of any great self-discovery.</span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>&#160; &#160; &#160;Each definition is slightly different - and tends to reflect the field of endeavour of each pioneer. It was the same whoever I asked: the prominent historian would say exploration was a thing of the past, the cutting-edge scientist would say it was of the present. And so on. They each set their own particular criteria; the common factor in their approach being that they all had, unlike many of us who simply enjoy travel or discovering new things, both a very definite objective from the outset and also a desire to record their findings.</span><br></div></span></div><br><div>&#160; &#160; &#160;I'd best declare my own bias. As a writer, I'm interested in the exploration of ideas. I've done a great many expeditions and each one was unique. I've lived for months alone with isolated groups of people all around the world, even two 'uncontacted tribes'. But none of these things is of the slightest interest to anyone unless, through my books, I've found a new slant, explored a new idea. Why? Because the world has moved on. The time has long passed for the great continental voyages - another walk to the poles, another crossing of the Empty Quarter. We know how the land surface of our planet lies; exploration of it is now down to the details - the habits of microbes, say, or the grazing behaviour of buffalo. Aside from the deep sea and deep underground, it's the era of specialists. However, this is to disregard the role the human mind has in conveying remote places; and this is what interests me: how a fresh interpretation, even of a well-travelled route, can give its readers new insights.<br></div>",

          "answer": "Ageing population has long been a topic of concern, with many people believing that it results in issues for governments, while some individuals think that it is a beneficial thing if society has more old people. This essay aims to delve into both sides and determine wheter the advantages of having an ageing population outweigh the disadvantages.<div><br></div><div>On the one hand, the increase of people's age provides benefits. T<span>he increase of people's age can encourage them to experience more, s</span><span>ome individuals are old but they still want to enjoy and explore new things that they have not tried. For example, they want to do things when they are young like travelling to a new city to explore different cultures, or trying new cuisines that they never had before. This results in a satisfaction and happiness when old people still can explore more. Furthermore, people who live longer can tell past events. For instance, they can tell families about their past like what was the city looked like or they can talk about their experience of doing something. Consequently, these people can provide new information about their previous years.</span></div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, ageing population also has drawbacks for gorvenments. When people live longer, the population increases in cities, giving more difficulties to the gorvenment. For instance, being able to cope a big city is already a challenge, but governments have to handle the population of citizens, especially the increase of elderly people. Therefore, government systems have to face agaisnt multiple problems.</div><div><br></div><div>Although ageing population has drawbacks such as the growing population of elderly people, it's benefits still outweigh the drawbacks. It is recommended for governments to cope the growing population while limiting the increase of old people.</div>",

This essay aim to delve into the argument and give the personal viewpoints.&#160;<div><br><div><div>On the one hand, government should ban dangerous sport because it can harm for people and it may effect other people.

For instance, If inexperienced people want to join in dangerous sport , they will find the trainer to guide them. Moreover, the trainer can get the livelihood.</div><div><br></div><div>In my personal perspective, I think people have the freedom to choose because people know that what think will good for them and this is a hobby for some people. Firstly, people will know what think will good for them. The illustration for this one is If people have problem in physical health they will not choose dangerous sport. They know that this thing is not sustainable for them. Second, dangerous sport is the hobby of some people. For instance, some people participant in dangerous sport because they feel fun. This sport helps their life be more colorful.</div><div><br></div><div>In conclusion, both opinions is correct. If people realize what think is good for them, so we don't need to ban dangerous sport. However, If people just participate without consider, so the government should ban dangerous sport.&#160;</div><div><br></div></div></div>",
